Masked executioners in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip on Wednesday hanged a man who was convicted of stabbing to death an acquaintance over money, ignoring protests by human rights activists who say the territory's legal system is flawed.

Hani Abu Aliyan, 28, was executed in a security compound in the presence of relatives of the victim, a first for a criminal case in Gaza. Previously, only security officials had witnessed executions.

At Wednesday's execution, the 17th since Hamas overran Gaza six years ago, four masked security men escorted Abu Aliyan to a noose erected on a small platform surrounded by black plastic tarps. Abu Aliyan wore a hood, spoke to a cleric and uttered a Muslim prayer before he was hanged, a witness said.

Gaza's Interior Ministry released pictures of the executioners and rows of armed security men, also masked, standing on the sides.

1. Isolating, dehumanizing and embargoing a whole territory is the same as creating a penal colony. When people have nothing to hope for, nothing to look forward to, their society will decay and radicalism will take hold.

When will we learn? <img src="/emoticons/cry.gif"/>

2. 32 states in the US have the death penalty As do dozens of countries around the world.

In spite of people having things to hope for and look forward to.

3. Yes. The way I learned your argument was a question:
Is this argument valid (true), "98.5% of convicted murderers enjoy it when they're served perfect mashed potatoes, with their favorite sauce. Therefore mashed potatoes with sauce is the cause of murder."

I wouldn't let the fuckers off so easily.

4. HUH? I'm not sure what your trying to convey with that comparison. These Isolated area's, Gaza and the West bank, are not free states. The people do not have freedoms, nor are they equally represented in the government. There aren't settler camps in the United States, where the natives are cast out so that an identifiably religious group can move in.
There is no comparison between Gaza and Florida, or any other state.

10. 'There aren't settler camps in the United States where the natives are cast out...' Not nowadays, because that mission was sadly accomplished in the 19th century!

5. So if I understand your post correctly, Israel is responsible for Hamas' action?

8. Of course you don't. The post does point out critically important difference in circumstance. The circumstance of a country and states with varying laws within that country, the country being in spite of many flaws a true democracy, and a racist state that has put the non-racially-elite indigenous population under occupation and siege for three generations now, so that grandparents see their grandchildren born into a ceaseless oppression entirely determined by *race*.

The post is merely pointing out that this essential difference in kind is critically important. No more, no less. So you, King_David, being a voice of hasbara for the racist state perpetrating the monstrous actions, are in no position to judge.

Circumstances aren't all determining, else the very notion of 'ethics' would be incoherent, but circumstances *are* of critical importance in determining our situational judgements, esp. when those circumstances are different in essence.

11. so you've redefined race today.... you sure have a great dictionary there....

i guess those dumb israeli arabs simply don't know anything and believe that they are related to the paletesnians arabs....but you know better then them

so that grandparents see their grandchildren born into a ceaseless oppression entirely determined by *race*

is it because your 'white"? live in a western country? how is it you know better than the locals what their racial identities should be?
