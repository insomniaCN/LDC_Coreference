Hi,

Thank you for reading..
I recently divorced and moved away with my two children under 7y.o. to a flat; employing a live in au pair to look after boys whilst i am working.

When I called local Council tax office and expalined the situation they applied a single occupancy in March 2010; however I noticed it was removed now. When I called they said that they adjusted it in April 2010 as second person lives with me - and they named the lady's name, who lives and looks after my children when I am at work.

I am still waiting for her application to Ofstead to be approved so that I can claim some help towards the childcare cost under Working Tax scheme; however it becomes a a costly existing to work...

I have been adviced to email Council asking them to readjust last year's figure. Before I do this I wanted to make sure that I am definately qualifying for a single occupancy discount given circumstances?

Thank you,

Oli2011

If the au pair lives with you then you don't qualify for a single person discount.
