By Editorial Board, Published: January 11
ECUADOREAN PRESIDENT Rafael Correa, an autocratic acolyte of Hugo Chavez who is usually and deservedly ignored outside of his own country, will get a little attention Thursday when he hosts Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. As he basks in the aura of a more notorious international pariah, allow us to recount what Mr. Correa really ought to be known for: the most comprehensive and ruthless assault on free media underway in the Western Hemisphere.

On Friday, after the Iranians departure, the National Court of Justice in Quito is due to hear a final appeal by three directors of one of Latin Americas most venerable newspapers, El Universo, which Mr. Correa is on the verge of destroying. In July, the papers three directors  brothers Carlos, Cesar and Nicolas Perez  and editorial editor Emilio Palacio were sentenced to three years in prison as a result of a defamation lawsuit brought by Mr. Correa. The editors and their newspaper were also fined a total of $40 million  enough to force its shutdown.

The crime that prompted the presidents lawsuit was a column by Mr. Palacio, titled No to the Lies, that harshly criticized Mr. Correas provocative behavior during a police uprising. The handling of the case by the judiciary was, alas, worthy of a banana republic. After four changes of judge, a temporary magistrate took over the case, held one hearing, and  33 hours after his appointment  issued the 156-page ruling. A subsequent independent investigation determined that he did not write it, and that the author was probably Mr. Correas attorney.

-----------
Journalists who dare to be critical are targeted with defamation suits filed by the president, who attends hearings and sometimes tweets rulings before they are announced. Last month, the editor of another newspaper, Hoy, was sentenced to three months in jail after he refused to name the author of unsigned articles reporting on influence-peddling by a central bank director who is Mr. Correas second cousin. Two other journalists face a presidential demand for $10 million in damages for a book documenting hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts given to Mr. Correas brother.

1. LOL Does a report which starts with a sentence like "Rafael Correa, an autocratic acolyte of Hugo Chavez who is usually and deservedly ignored outside of his own country, will get a little attention Thursday" deserve any attention at all? Did a teenager write this?

No. It doesn't.

2. I also L-O-V-E-D this one: "the most comprehensive and ruthless assault on free media underway in the Western Hemisphere."

As if there was anything like a "free media" in the Western Hemisphere... <img src="/emoticons/happy.gif"/>

I'm aware that Washington Post has never been exactly a trustable or respectable news source, but in recent years the quality of their reports is incredibly low. I recall reading gossip magazines pieces and tabloids reports quite better written than this article.

4. The fact that it is an editorial just makes it worse. Makes the Washington Post editorial board looks like a bunch of school pamphlet writers.

The quality of the writing is garbage. The opinions expressed are childish and shallow. It's so ridiculous that is disrespectful towards the readers.

5. you should comment on the article to WP then? what do you think about Rafa's suppression of the media though. he's a little bitch ain't he?

6. I saw no evidence of suppression of media. At all.

As a Latin American, I know quite well what kind of press we got here. Most media groups act like criminal organisations. They must be treated as such when they do cross the line of crime.

So, way to go, "Rafa".

7. Thank you, ocpagu! My sentiments exactly. The editorial is garbage. It is also worrisome. Ecuador is oil target no. 2 of our Corporate Rulers/War Profiteers in South America.

8. Criminalizing media criticism is not the mark of a progressive politician

9. But......what if the media criticism indeed falls under the category of crime?

I believe media barons are not (or shouldn't be) above the law. Correa was even accused, without any evidences, of murder. That's a crime, isn't it?

<post author="Zorro" datetime="2012-01-13T22:55:00" id="p11">
10. Nope. Not a crime If you were familiar with the US media, you would remember the murder accusations against the Clintons.

11. Looks like crime to me... I'm quite familiar with the US media. It's certainly not a model to follow.

12. Freedom of the press is not a model to follow? True progressives would argue that it's one of the hallmarks of a democratic society.
