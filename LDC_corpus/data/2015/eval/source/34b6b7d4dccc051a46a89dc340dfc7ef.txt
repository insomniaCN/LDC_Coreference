Used credit card to pay for IT course for my son. The college (Advent Training ) went bust in January, can I claim cost of course from the credit card company (£6000) ?

I'm in a similar position as I paid for training with Property Professionals which went bust earlier this week. I paid £6000 via a loan in someone else's name but I also paid the deposit of £800 on one of my credit cards.

Does this mean I can approach the credit card company under section 75 for the whole amount of £6800 and should my loan guarantor send a similar letter to the loan company too?

Both of you would probably get more replies if this were on the Consumer Rights or Credit Card boards.

This is a clear easy application of section 75. The worst case scenario that I can see is that the credit card company could argue only a partial refund if you've had some of the course. I don't actually know whether or not they'd be in the right, but if they do that and you lose the fight then at least you're not completely out of pocket.

Thanks for the feedback.

I will also create a thread in the Consumer Rights/Credit Card boards.
