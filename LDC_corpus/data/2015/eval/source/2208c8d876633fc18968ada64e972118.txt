"French topless male protesters stage anti-equal marriage D-Day landing protest"

A campaign group formed to protest against recently passed equal marriage legislation in France, has staged a D-Day landing recreation, topless, to show their continued opposition to equal marriage in the country.

Les Hommen posted the video earlier this week, which features the protesters disembarking from an inflatable boat onto the Utah beach.

The men wear blank masks to hide their identity, and unfurl a banner reading: Liberez Nicolas, referring to a protester who was jailed for being part of an illegal protest.

Equal marriage opponents in France last month took to the streets on Friday to protest against the prison term given to Nicolas Bernard-Busee, who was part of an illegal anti-equal marriage demonstration, who fled from police, and gave a false identity when caught.

1. But you know what is funny about this? We are not the one's hiding our identity. <img src="/emoticons/happy.gif"/>

2. Whom do they think will be convinced by this ridiculous, and thoroughly homoerotic protest?
