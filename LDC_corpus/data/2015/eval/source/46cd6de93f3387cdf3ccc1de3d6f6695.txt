Chilean police arrest fugitive Argentine judge
Saturday, 25 February 2012 02:17

SANTIAGO: A fugitive judge accused of human rights violations during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 military dictatorship was arrested Friday in Chile.

"Otilio Romano was arrested in Renaca this Friday at noon and was made available to the Supreme Court," a Chilean police source told AFP.

Romano entered Chile August 24 seeking political asylum and was given an eight-month visa. He was declared a fugitive the next month after failing to respond to an Argentine court summons.

Chilean Supreme Court judge Adalis Oyarzun issued the arrest warrant after examining an extradition request from Argentina, a judicial source told AFP.
