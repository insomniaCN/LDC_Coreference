Man acquitted of assault on preacher

Victim, however, found guilty of harassing a woman a week before funeral melee

BAY MINETTE -- A Baldwin County judge Thursday acquitted a man implicated in a funeral brawl last summer, but convicted the victim of that beating -- a minister -- of harassing a woman a week earlier.

The melee broke out in June when relatives gathered in Loxley for the funeral of Lish Taylor charged the pulpit and dragged Orlando Bethel outside Pine Grove Baptist Church. The mourners reacted strongly to Bethel's condemnation of the deceased and to them, according to various accounts of the funeral.

Bethel, 35, a lay preacher who calls himself "the Apostle Orlando Bethel," said he suffered several injuries in the attack, including a broken nose. Only one of the three men accused of participating in the alleged attack responded to a summons to appear in court.

Baldwin County District Judge Jody Bishop cited conflicting testimony in finding the defendant, Alden D. Taylor of Chicago, innocent of third-degree assault.

Taylor, a nephew of Lish Taylor, was present in court.

Bishop also dismissed or acquitted several others of charges and counter charges related to the funeral and its aftermath.

Bishop found Bethel innocent of third-degree assault stemming from a dispute that occurred hours after the June 14 funeral at the house of his brother-in-law, Jasper Lemuel Molden. He dismissed menacing charges against Bethel and his wife, Glynis Bethel, related to the same incident.

But Bishop determined that the evidence supported one charge against Orlando Bethel: harassing communications. The charge centered on a hand-written sheet that he admitted tacking to Molden's door on June 8. The note admonished Jasper Molden, and his then-fiancée, Shannon Molden.

"God told me to let you two know that this is HOLY ground. and repent for fornication and sinning. Shannon is a: WHORE," the note reads. "Lemuel is a wicked!! WHOREMONGER."

Bishop imposed a 60-day suspended jail sentence, fined Bethel $200 and placed him on 12 months probation. He also ordered him to have no contact with Shannon Molden.

Shannon Molden, 29, who testified that the note scared her, said after Thursday's hearing that she fears Orlando still.

"I've never seen religious people act this way," she said.

Bethel, who announced he will appeal the conviction to Circuit Court, said all he was doing was preaching the Gospel. He said that many people take offense at that because they ignore the Bible's words. He expressed disgust at his own conviction and with Taylor's acquittal.

"I was disappointed that today in the United States, a preacher cannot preach the Gospel freely," he said.

Lish Taylor's funeral was proceeding routinely enough June 14 when, according to all of Thursday's witnesses, Orlando Bethel was invited to sing during the ceremony.

After he finished singing, however, Bethel shocked the congregation by telling them that Taylor's sinful life had sent him to hell. He then warned the gathered mourners to repent their sins or suffer the same fate.

Bethel confirmed this account during his testimony Thursday. He testified that the Holy Spirit compelled him to speak out because "fornicators," "whoremongers" and a lesbian were present.

Bethel said that a mob of people attacked him. He testified that Alden Taylor held him down while others beat him.

David Marshall, a member of Bethel's ministry, testified that he saw Taylor strike Bethel's face, slap him and drag him outside of the church.

Taylor acknowledged in his testimony that he ran up toward the pulpit with a large group and followed the men outside. But he testified that he never laid a hand on Bethel. Molden also testified that he never saw Taylor strike or hold Bethel.

Defense attorney Michael Dasinger challenged Bethel about his actions during the funeral, demanding to know if any of the funeral organizers had asked him to deliver a sermon.

"You don't have to ask a minister to preach. That's what he does," Bethel responded.

Assistant District Attorney John Gamble said that incorrect addresses or other defects prevented summonses from reaching two others accused of third-degree assault, Stephen Taylor and Romaine Taylor. He said further attempts would be made to serve them.
