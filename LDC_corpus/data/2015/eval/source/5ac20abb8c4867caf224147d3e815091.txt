Slovakia's center-left leader Robert Fico scored a landslide election victory over the weekend with his Smer party. The former lawyer swept the conservative SDKU party of Foreign Minister Mikulas Dzurinda from power in the early election, called after the cabinet fell apart in a row over the euro rescue fund last October after just 15 months in office. It has been acting in a caretoker role since then.
...
Final, unofficial results showed Smer took 44.4 percent of the vote on Saturday, giving it 83 of parliament's 150 seats. Damaged by allegations of graft, Dzurinda's party won just 6.1 percent, less than half of what it garnered in 2010.

The size of the victory has led to comparisons with the sweeping win by Hungary's center-right Fidesz party of Viktor Orban in 2010. Fico and Orban, though at opposite ends of the political spectrum, are both seen as populists prone to nationalist rhetoric, and both have harangued the press and passed controversial media laws, as well as criticizing foreign-owned companies operating in their countries.

Fico has vowed to raise taxes on the rich, doubling a tax on bank deposits to 0.7 percent, raising corporate tax to 22 percent from 19 percent, and raising income tax for those earning over Â€33,000 ($43,200) per year. He has also criticized reforms by the previous government that made it easier to hire and fire workers.

2. SMER has 55% of the seats in parliament. The right wing Fidesz has 70% of the seats in the Hungarian parliament.
Fico and his part have shown no hostility towards the democratic process. At the same time, the right wing Fidesz has shown.
