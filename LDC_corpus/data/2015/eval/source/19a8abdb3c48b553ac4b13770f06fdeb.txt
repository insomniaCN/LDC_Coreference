First of all, I understand that divorce is a sin. That God hates divorce. I am a Christian as is my ex husband yet we are divorced. He emotionally abandoned me and refused to go to counseling and try to work on our marriage. He wanted the marriage to end. I did not. I am still deeply in love with him and, even now, I still pray for reconciliation.

We were divorced on friday afternoon. Last night we made love. I'm wondering if that was a sin. It's strange because I don't feel divorced from him and he says he feels that same way about me. I wonder if this is because, when we were married, we became one flesh and we will never truly not be husband and wife in God's eyes. Anyways, what happened last night did not feel like a sin. It felt right but I can't tell if it felt that way because I am blinded by my love for him.

So my question is, is it wrong for a christian couple, who are divorced, to have sex with each other? This is not something I plan on continuing. I just am not sure if I sinned or not.

NOTE TO OTHERS READING THIS THREAD: As stated <a href="http://www.christianforums.com/t7357604/">here</a>, only Christian Forum Chaplains or the original poster may respond to the opening post. Thanks!

It is a sin. You have divorced. The God-ordained state authorities have so ruled. Scripture also declares you divorced by the state's ruling. Thus, you are sinning to have intimate relations outside of the covenant of marriage.

Have you spoken to your pastor about this? I am glad you have decided to not repeat this.
