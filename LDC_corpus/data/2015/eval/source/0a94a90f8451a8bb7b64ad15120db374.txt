NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) Â– A jury has been chosen for the U.S. terror trial of an Egyptian Islamic preacher extradited from Great Britain on charges he conspired to support al Qaeda.

It took just a few hours for eight men and four women along with four alternates to be chosen Monday for the trial of Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, who is also known by the aliases Abu Hamza and Abu Hamza al-Masri.

Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan said opening statements were to begin Thursday morning.

Forrest had Mustafa stand in court on Monday as she told prospective jurors that both of his arms have been amputated and asked them if anything about his physical appearance or his disability would affect their ability to be fair. Mustafa has one eye and claims to have lost his hands fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
