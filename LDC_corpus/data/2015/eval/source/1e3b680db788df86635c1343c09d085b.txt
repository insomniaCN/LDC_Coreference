Officials said the group was led by Daniel Patrick Boyd, a married 39-year-old who lived in an unassuming lakeside home in a rural area south of Raleigh, where he and his family walked their dog and operated a drywall business. But two decades ago, Boyd, who is a U.S. citizen, trained in terrorist camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan and fought against the Soviets for three years before returning to the United States.

An indictment released Monday does not detail any specific terrorist plans or targets overseas, although it claims some of the defendants traveled to Israel in 2007 with the intent of waging "violent jihad" and returned home without success.

"These charges hammer home the point that terrorists and their supporters are not confined to the remote regions of some far away land but can grow and fester right here at home," U.S. Attorney George E.B. Holding said. He would not give details of the alleged plots beyond what was in a news release and indictment.

The seven men made their first court appearances in Raleigh on Monday, charged with providing material support to terrorism. If convicted, they could face life in prison. Court documents charged that Boyd, also known as 'Saifullah,' encouraged others to engage in jihad.

1. Your use of quotes is unnecessarily provocative. What if we called evangelical Christianity a "religion of peace" with quotation marks in place?

2. Don't get me wrong evangelical Christianity and even "moderate" Christianity is in the same league I just think that fewer people are aware of the dangers of Islam. By all means we should be criticizing both religions relentlessly and with equal fervor.

3. The dangers of Islam? No.

It's the danger of extremism.

The "dangers of Islam" is a RW dog-whistle.

4. You are right, it should be more encompassing. Maybe the danger of religion is more applicable. People use religion (all of them) in order to justify all kinds of horrific acts. There is no other "idea" that is tolerated as much as religion, especially when it is used to justify horrific acts. There IS danger in religion, that fact is indisputable.

5. You're right. People do use religion to justify horrific acts.

They use land, water, power, and money, too.

But to castigate religion based on the actions of extremists is, well, myopic.

6. I agree, but to praise religion based on the actions Of those that use their religion to do good is just as myopic, no?

7. I can agree with that. Being an 'adult' (in the Al Franken definition) means being able to see the good and bad in an institution.
