Former Super Bowl MVP Mark Rypien is the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit against the National Football League seeking cash and medical care for the "repeated traumatic injuries to his head" he suffered during his 11-year career.

In a suit filed March 23, Rypien is joined by 126 former NFL players who allege the league knew of risks of "repetitive traumatic brain injuries and concussions for decades, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed" the data, this according to court documents. The suit adds that the 49-year-old Rypien endured multiple head injuries during his career. He now reportedly suffers "various neurological conditions and symptoms related to multiple head traumas."

2. The Redskins still have a bad offensive line. Jason Campbell will have a good case also.
