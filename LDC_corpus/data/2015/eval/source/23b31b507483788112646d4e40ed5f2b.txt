The Dow Corning bankruptcy was to protect against claims from women suffering the health effects of silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/business/dow-corning-in-bankruptcy-over-lawsuits.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">Dow Corning In Bankruptcy Over Lawsuits</a> Overwhelmed by injury claims filed against it by hundreds of thousands of women who used silicone breast implants, the Dow Corning Corporation filed for bankruptcy protection in a Federal court in Bay City, Mich., today.

Dow Cornings legal move will abruptly halt all new lawsuits and indefinitely delay settlement of existing litigation against the company. Dow Corning said that seeking the protection of the bankruptcy court was the only way it could devise an enforceable plan to deal with the billions of dollars of claims against it. The decision also means, however, that the bankruptcy court will have the final say in how much Dow Corning pays to compensate claimants.
....
While Warren refuses to disclose what she did for Dow Chemical, it is pretty easy to surmise. Warren offered legal advice to the parent company of a company in or about to go into bankruptcy. That advice almost certainly concerned how to protect the parent company, Dow Chemical, from claims of women against Dow Corning. If Dow Corning did not have the assets to pay these women, Elizabeth Warren likely was helping make sure the women could not claim against the deep pocket, Dow Chemical.

There is nothing wrong with Elizabeth Warren representing a large chemical company to insulate it from the health claims of women. Its what lawyers do, and it was legal for a lawyer who held the necessary licenses.

What is wrong is for Elizabeth Warren to play the War on Women card and to pretend she is something she is not.

More to come. For sure.

How is that a war on women if she is doing her job? It isn't like she is going out of her way to convince women to get dodgy implants and then purposely stopping them from suing.

It just sounds like a random attack just for the sake of attack.

It it had been a Republican working for the Dow defense there would be one hell of an outcry by the Dems and the MSM.

Come on, you know this.

Isn't it generally accepted that lawyers have to do messed up stuff?

You maybe be right, but that doesn't mean the outcry against a Republican would be justified either.
