Cameroon Court Upholds Three Year Sentence for Gay Text 'I Love You'

DOUALA, Cameroon (AP)  An appeals court on Monday upheld a three-year sentence against a man found guilty of homosexual conduct for sending a text message to another man saying: Im very much in love with you.

Activists said the courts ruling in Yaounde, the capital, marked yet another setback for gays and lesbians in Cameroon, widely viewed as the most repressive country in Africa when it comes to prosecuting same-sex couples.

Jean-Claude Roger Mbede, 32, had been provisionally released on bail in July after serving a year and a half in prison. His lawyer has 10 days now to file an appeal to the countrys Supreme Court.

Holding back tears Monday, he said he wasnt sure whether he could withstand more jail time given the conditions he faced there.
