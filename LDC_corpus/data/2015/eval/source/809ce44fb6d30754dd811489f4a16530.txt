Manuel Roig-Franzia, Washington Post, 4/26/12

Madeleine Albright lives in one of those stately Georgetown residences, all brick outside and globally gathered tchotchkes inside. The home sits on one of those streets where the neighbors long ago got over the novelty of having a celebrity next door because, after all, so many celebrities occupy those blocks anyway, celebrities of the Washington sort, the kind whose stock is measured in discreetly mannered protectors wearing sunglasses and earpieces.

The agents who hovered around Albright  Madam Secretary, if you please, or Madam Cojones, as the Latinos called her after she chewed out the Cubans for the Brothers to the Rescue shoot down  are gone. But in her day, when she was the worlds most important globe-trotting diplomat, they took up residence in her garage. They watched over a historic figure, the countrys first female secretary of state.

She accepted the nomination in 1997, around the same time that Washington Post reporter Michael Dobbs discovered that she had Jewish roots and that three of her grandparents died in concentration camps. Albright, who was raised Catholic and later converted to Episcopalianism, has always maintained that her familys Jewish heritage was never revealed to her by her parents. Shes aware that some will never believe that she didnt know, and 11 / 2 decades hence, shes still making her case.

Theyre wrong, and Im right, she says of her doubters in an interview before this weeks release of her latest book, Prague Winter: A Personal Story of Remembrance and War, 1937-1948. The book contains her largest accounting of relatives who died in the Holocaust: 25.
