A gold Bugatti Veyron belonging to popular rapper Flo Rida has garnered praise and controversy after the hip-hop star decided to deck out the already expensive luxury car with a gold and chrome finish. The Bugatti Veyron is already one of the most expensive cars in the world, costing $1.7 million, leading some to criticize the lavish display as an exercise in excess.

The gold Bugatti Veyron was originally pearl white when Flo Rida, whose real name is Tramar Dillard, purchased it recently. The Miami-based rapper apparently wasn't satisfied, however, as he asked Hollywood, Fla. company Metro Wrapz to cover the car in 24-karat gold chrome, complete with a chrome wheels.

"I have very little time for Flo-rida's Gold Veyron. Surely it's like putting a moustache on the Mona Lisa," AutoBant tweeted. Some agreed, as the rapper's Bugatti Veyron is one of only 300 in the world- it's about as exclusive as you can get.

Yesterday, Justin Bieber was seen driving was seen driving away from Miley Cyrus house in an Audi R8 worth $200,000. But after this leopard-print-paint-job, its worth half that. The Biebs has crossed into the sports world as of late with his appearance at Heat-Pacers game 7, and his speeding around Keyshawn Johnson and Eric Dickersons neighborhood.

The R8 has a top speed of 199 mph, which should be enough to outrun the Prius with which Keyshawn chased after him and his goons, earlier this month. Lets just hope Bieber doesnt hit any pedestrians, it would really mess up the paint job.

If that doesn't scream "I'm a huge douchebag", what does? <img src="/emoticons/eyes.gif"/>
