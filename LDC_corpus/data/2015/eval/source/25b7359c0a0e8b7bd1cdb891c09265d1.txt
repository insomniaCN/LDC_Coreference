My mums partner has just died (friday) and his daughter has started harrasing my mum, hte next day, about all his bank books and his car and other bits and pieces that they had.

Ive had a bit of a look but cant find out any info about what she is intitled to. My mum and him lived together for 8 years in my mums council house (still in her name), he received a pension and she had a seperate pension (from july 2006) but im sure included in his pension was some money for my mum. He paid for most things, including bills and she gave him her money as well. His daughter has taken all his bank things, cards and books and all his personal stuff other then his clothes. She is being a right nasty cow. Phoning my mum up and demanding his will (which my mum has never seen and didnt even know he had one) then get her friends to phone my mum up saying how upset she is.
My mum is very strong in that sense and is grieving for her partner (which youd think his daughter would be too), Know im all for going over to the daughter and giving her a mouthful plus more but before i say anything to her i want to know my facts.
So can anyone point me in the right direction as to where i can find some answers.

Thanks for your help.

AFAIK the law does not recognise "common law wives" for the purposes of wills etc. If he has died intestate then the money will pass to his children.

One to take legal advice on really. Have you got access to a free legal helpline through your household or motor insurers?

Oh - and not sure if you are in the right forum btw.
