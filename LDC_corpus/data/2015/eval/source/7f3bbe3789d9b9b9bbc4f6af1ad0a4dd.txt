White supremacist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin was executed Wednesday morning after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final requests for a stay, prison officials in Bonne Terre, Missouri, said. CNN affiliate KMOV reported Franklin was executed at 6:17 a.m. CT (7:17 a.m. ET).
The execution, which had been scheduled for shortly after midnight Wednesday, was delayed for hours because of court appeals.
