'Machete' takes swing at state

<P>
A lawsuit filed by Austin filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and the production company behind his film ''Machete’' accuses The Texas Film Commission of denying agreed-to financial incentives after the agency decided the film was ''inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
Machete Chop Shop Inc. says in a suit filed Saturday in Travis County that the commission backed out of partially reimbursing the cost of the film after coming under fire for its violence and depiction of Texans.
</P>
<P>
Before the movie was released in September 2010, anti-immigration groups were upset over the film’s trailer, citing its violent imagery and Robert DeNiro’s cartoonish role as a senator who kills illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, the producers’ application for a grant under the Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program was approved in May 2009, one month after Gov. Rick Perry signed the program into law at Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios.
</P>
<P>
At the bill signing, Rod-riguez announced that the bill would allow him to make films in Texas, including ''Machete.''
</P>
<P>
The complaint states that former commission head Bob Hudgins verified that the script complied with content requirements and also claims he approved the incentive package.
</P>
<P>
Once filmmakers knew they had additional state funding, they increased their budget, the complaint says, banking on a state contribution of nearly $8 million. XXX - End of Story&lt;3D&gt;
