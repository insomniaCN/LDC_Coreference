ANTI-WAR PROTESTER ARRESTED IN FOREIGN OFFICE PROTEST

An anti-war protester has been arrested outside the Foreign Office in
Whitehall in a dramatic visual protest against the imminent attacks on
Fallujah.

After climbing onto the side of the Foreign Office building next to the
gates of Downing Street, the protestor stencilled Dont Attack
Fallujah, Black Watch Out onto the wall and splashed it with fake
blood.

He was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

Shortly before being detained, the protester, Milan Rai, said:

Today is a day of fear for the people of Fallujah. They need our active
solidarity.

The protest comes as the anti-war movement mobilises against the massive
assault planned on Iraqs cities.

On Sunday, a protestor scaled the gates of Downing Street and remained
for 45 minutes, while others blocked traffic in Oxford Circus.

Around 500 people including Professor Stephen Hawking gathered in
Trafalgar Square last night in a Naming the Dead ceremony to remember
those who have died in the Iraq war.

Similar ceremonies took place in other town centres around the country.

An emergency demonstration against the looming attacks in Iraq will take
place in Parliament Square at 2pm on Sunday 7th November. A funeral
procession will proceed to the Cenotaph to lay white flowers for those
at risk.
