This remains unconfirmed and so, hope still lives.

Newsmax says he is still alive and other sources report his death is as yet unconfirmed.

Continue to pray for his release, for his family and community and for other believers in Iran and other Islamic countries.

That's what I thought. I thought he converted, seeing that he could spare Christ the pain of the cross for as much as he could himself recieve Karma for his sins......

Well he's gone to be with the Lord, which is better by far. Our prayers are with his loved ones.

Maybe those people who say Islam is peace will sit up and take note.
