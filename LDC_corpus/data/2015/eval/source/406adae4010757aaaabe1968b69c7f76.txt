australians,you must be so proud.. <img src="images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/australiaandthepacific/australia/4352400/Violence-mars-Australias-national-day-celebrations.html">Violence mars Australia's national day celebrations</a>

Each January 26, Australians gather in parks and on beaches to celebrate all that is great about their country: mateship, sunshine, barbecues and free-flowing beer.

But this year, across the country's most populous state, the day of national pride turned violent when groups of youths rampaged through suburbs targetting non-white shopkeepers in a display of racism that echoed the ugly scenes of the 2005 Cronulla riots.

In the affluent Sydney suburb of Manly, where hundreds of families had set up their picnics for the day, more than 100 shirtless young men draped in "Aussie pride" flags smashed car windows and vandalised shops.
Carrying signs that read "---- off we're full", they paraded up and down the seafron threatening bypassers.

One 18-year-old Asian woman was injured when the gang smashed her car window, showering her in glass and causing several cuts to her arms.
There were also reports that the group attacked a taxi driven by an Indian Sikh and an Asian shopkeeper.

In scenes reminiscent of the Cronulla riots, when 5,000 white Australians congregated in the Sydney beachfront suburb and attacked Lebanese immigrants, groups of men jumped on cars that were stopped at traffic lights and chanted racist slogans to the terrified passengers.
At one point the gang was reportedly heard singing "lets go ---- with these Lebs".

Jean Hay, the mayor of Manly, said the youths came from the north-west of Sydney and were not Manly residents.

The unrest was brought under control by the late afternoon. Police charged a 16-year-old for assaulting police and three others were cautioned for offensive and dangerous behaviour.

The violence in Manly was mirrored in the coastal towns of Shellharbour to Sydney's south and Port Macquarie to the north. Fights were also reported as far north as Queensland's Gold Coast, where hundreds of teenagers clashed on a popular family beach.
