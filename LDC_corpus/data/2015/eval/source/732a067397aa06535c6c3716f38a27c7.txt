After seven months of sobriety and eight months of self-imposed celibacy, I decided to push the envelope and start dating again. During my recovery, and I didn't realize this until I opened myself up to men (I am bi) but "marketabilty" has grown considerably since getting sober and working out, etc. Another older woman said that sobriety can be better than plastic surgery.

Anyway, I met this professional man from San Jose, divorced five years, three adult children, he rescued his addict/bi-polar son from the streets a year ago when his son finally came to him ready for help, got him in rehab, got him a job and allows him to rent a room in his house and save money to get out on his own. I accepted a date with him Saturday night and we had a great time at a couple of great Halloween parties, then I succumbed to my desire to end my celibacy breaking my three date pledge. (None of us are saints) Turns out, we hit it off big time in the sack, spent the good part of 24 hours in that regard. Not to brag, but he absolutely adores what I do for him sexually. (And I love the way he loves too) We also feel very comfortable just being together, he is very affectionate and an old-fashioned type gentelman, opening the car door, etc. He is also fairly well off. So Saturday night turned into a two day date and we are meeting again today and going o spend the evening and morning together, we also have tentative plans for the weekend together.

Now keep in mind, I am a sexual and relationship addict as well, in being honest with myself, I realize it was a mistake to get this involved so early in my recovery. OTOH this guy at his point seems perfect for me and almost exactly what I was looking for. He seems to be even more hot for me than I am for him which might be good. So I guess that both of us are fools rushing in where angels fear to tread.

I am self-aware enough to know that this relationship is "progressing" way too fast. OTOH some of my advisers say sometimes it just happens that way when you meet Mr or MS Right. As well, I did have the belief that my higher power would allow someone to come into my life who is right for me. And I believe that if it doesn't work out, then my higher power has something better in store for me. In reality though, I think if this affair ended abruptly, I would be very hurt. But then again too, probably only for a few days until the next one comes along. One thing I realize, there are far more many men looking fo someone like me than I could date in ten lifetimes.

One other thing, this guy is already talking (kiddingly?) marriage but, in all seriousness, he is looking for a long term relationship and has been for quite some time. For me, this may be the first time in my life in a real relationship as I was unable to experience real love and intimacy while my mind was clouded with drugs and alcohol.

So am I rushing in too fast.? (I know the answer) But given that, what do I do now?

Unfortunately, meeting either "the" right person or "a" right person does not always happen to a timetable or plan. That's the wonder of real life! If this guy seems right, and he feels the same, it may well work out. Speed of becoming attached to each other is not an indicator either way, good or bad, in my opinion. I once met a lady at a Halloween party, we were both drunk, we went back to my place that night, we moved in in together the next March, that was in 1993. We are still together and we are inseparable and very very happy. On the other hand, I knew my first wife for 4 years before we got hitched, and it turned out to be a disaster.

Mind you, the very fact that you are asking "Is it OK to love this guy?" on a web forum may indicate that you have doubts and/or reservations, and maybe you should spend some time clarifying what these may be.
