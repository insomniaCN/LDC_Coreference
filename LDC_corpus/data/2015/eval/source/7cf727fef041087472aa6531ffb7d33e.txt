Ten 20-year-olds in Norway have been sentenced with community service and fined a collective equivalent of Â£10,200 after they lured a middle-aged gay man with a fake dating profile and then attacked him with a baseball bat and BB-gun.

The men had created a dating profile on Gaysir.no to lure an unnamed gay man in his 50s to the Ingierstrand swimming lake, southeast of Oslo.

They surrounded him and attacked him in a car park near a wooded area, where one of the 20-year-olds swung a baseball bat and another began firing BB-gun pellets.
