Knox Gelatin
Let us endeavor to live, so that when we die, even the undertaker will be sorry.
Mark Twain

Rose Markward married Charles Knox in 1893. The couple bought a small gelatin business in Johnstown, New York, and Rose tested gelatin recipes in her kitchen at home. The ambitious couple also acquired several other businesses, including a newspaper, a hardware store, and even a power company. However, when Charles died, Rose sold all of the companies except the gelatin business. She was very interested in finding new ways of using gelatin, and she set up an experimental kitchen in which to conduct research. Roses enthusiasm to make something from gelatin showed as the companys profit line tripled from 1908 to 1925, with sales topping the $1 million mark.
Besides being involved in the business operation, Rose became active in the Johnstown community. She founded the Federation of Womens Clubs for Civic Improvement and in 1949 was named Americas Foremost Woman Industrialist by Colliers magazine. Rose continued as president of the company until she was ninety years old. She died in 1950 at age ninety-three. Rose Knox was a determined soul who took the business she loved and devoted all her energy to making it a success. In a 1937 interview in Time, she stated, I just used common sensea man would call it horse sensein running my business. But from the first, I determined to run it in what I called a womans way.
Consider This: Your business, career, or job is an extension of your personality. In order to achieve success, your personality and occupation must meld together like a team.
