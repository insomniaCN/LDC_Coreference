Feared 'Tiger' is out as top cop in Honduras

TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) Â— Honduras' national police chief, a man who intimidated many in this violent country with a fearsome reputation colored by allegations he ran death squads a decade ago, is out of a job.

Gen. Juan Carlos Bonilla was removed as chief Thursday by President Porfirio Lobo, who said he acted after consulting with President-elect Juan Orlando Hernandez, who takes office next month. No reasons were given, but the change had been widely expected because of the impending change in administrations.

While acquitted of 2002 charges that he directed the killings of criminals as a lower-level official, Bonilla was dogged by the allegations, and critics questioned why he was named chief of a police force often accused of abuses and corruption. Supporters praised Bonilla as the right man for the post, noting he has never been linked to organized crime.

The firing had been viewed as likely since the Nov. 24 election of Hernandez, who has argued that a cleanup effort failed to weed out corrupt officers and shake up the National Police, which is Honduras' only police force.

President Porfirio Lobo of Honduras has fired the country's national police chief, after mounting accusations of human right abuses committed by him and his force.

Lobo said he made the decision to remove General Juan Carlos Bonilla, who had expressed interest in leaving, in consultations with President-elect Juan Orlando Hernandez, who comes to office January 27.
Although the decision was expected in the wake of the nearing change in administration, neither Lobo nor Hernandez explained the reasons for the firing.

The incoming president has voiced doubt in efforts to root out corruption in the National Police, Honduras' only police force.

Bonilla, who was known as "the Tiger," was charged in 2002 of alleged human rights violations stemming from accusations he headed a social cleansing campaign that killed criminals while he was a regional police chief.
He was later acquitted of one alleged death squad killing by a court whose ruling was upheld by Honduras' Supreme Court in 2009.

In August 2012, Lobo put him at the top of Honduras' National Police department, which faces frequent allegations of beating, killing and "disappearing" people who are detained.
