Obama's Giveaway to the Communists

By Phyllis Schalfly
January 15, 2013

The China problem is not just that China is raking in trillions of dollars because of Obama's spending and borrowing binges, and it's not just that government policies encourage well-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs to move overseas. An even bigger problem is that the Obama administration is about to give Communist China some of our most precious and up-to-date military technology. This particular chicanery started when the Obama administration foolishly tried to use taxpayers' money to force green energy to replace fossil fuels. But green energy can't compete in the free market because it's so much more expensive to produce.

Obama gave a half-billion U.S. tax dollars to Solyndra to subsidize making solar panels, yet the company promptly went bankrupt. Then Obama awarded a grant of $250 million of Stimulus money to a firm called A123 to make batteries for electric cars, which also went bankrupt and now is trying to pay off its investors by auctioning the company.

The high bidder at $256 million in a December auction was the Wanxiang Group, which has close ties to Communist China's government. Its chief executive is one of the wealthiest men in China, a prominent figure in the Chinese Communist Party.

This sale is dangerous to U.S. security because it involves the transfer of advanced battery technology using lithium iron phosphate, which produces longer life, lighter weight, higher power and more stable batteries that can operate in both very low and very high temperatures. In China's hands, the new A123 technology will threaten U.S. electrical power and communications grids.

Where have you been? I've been posting information related to the destructive operations of the Democratic Party for years. Obama is just the head of the festering Marxist pustule at the present time.

It be a simple question of magnitude, here. Like stars.

If George Bush's deficit spending were on the order of the size of the sun, the size of Barack Obama's deficit spending would be, by comparison, on the order of VY Canis Majoris as shown on the link.

<a href="http://www.universetoday.com/25331/size-of-stars/">Size of Stars</a>

The reason why the spending is so large can probably be deduced from an Air Force Officer's summation on why he retired when he did. "During the Bush (1) Administration the Republicans appointed people to head departments and cabinet posts that been in business and had experience efficiently running large organizations. When Clinton came in, the appointees were all people who had chained themselves to the gates of nuclear power plants or had spent their time interfering with commercial whaling ships.

Former Harvard University President Larry Summers quickly jumped ship when he got a glimpse of the goings on formulating the Obama stimulus package, the underlying basis for the enormous jump in the size of the US deficit. Mr Summers reasoned that he still had a reasonable career expectancy left ahead of him as a reliable, rational economist and that he should get out while the getting was still good before he became tainted for life by the brewing Obama economic debacle. We've had four years so far of economic depression under Obama mimicking FDR's Great Depression. We only have eight more to suffer through.

Today, as in the period 1933 -1945, every dollar that is sucked down into the Government's maw, that gigantic financial black hole located on the banks of the Potomac, comes off the backs of, off the feet of, and out of the mouths of the American people.
