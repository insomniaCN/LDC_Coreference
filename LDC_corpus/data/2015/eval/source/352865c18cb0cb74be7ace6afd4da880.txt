Career diplomat and former deputy assistant Secretary of State for South America in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere affairs, Kevin Whitaker, arrived in Bogota to take up his new position as the US ambassador to Colombia, the countrys Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Wednesday.

Whitaker was received at the Palacio de San Carlos, housing Colombias Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by Foreign Minister Maria Angela Holguin in an official ceremony where the newly appointed ambassador presented his credentials.

The veteran diplomat was nominated for the post by President Barack Obama on September 19, 2013, and was sworn in to office on April 28.

In 2005, Whitaker was appointed deputy chief of mission at the US Embassy in Venezuela until 2007. He was later named director of the Office of Andean Affairs.
