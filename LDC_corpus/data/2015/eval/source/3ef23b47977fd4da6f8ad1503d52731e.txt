I was supposed to have a date last night. I've known this guy for five years. We went out to a movie and a club Friday night. He wanted me to go to a concert then back to the club Saturday night. I spent two hours getting ready (including dying my hair, which I would've done anyway, but still). Then I waited for an hour and a half before I gave up. I text messaged him twice and have been calling him. He's not answering his cell phone.

What the hell? Couldn't he at least call me if he ended up having to work or something? It's totally out of character for this guy to just not show. Things have come up with our plans before (he's a manager and has to work a lot) but he's always let me know so I'm not waiting on him.

I was really looking forward to going out, too. Now I have to wait until New Year's to do anything since nothing's open tonight.

That really bites about your date. Hopefully, he will call with a good explanation.

Just a question. Why do you have to wait until New Years to do anything? I know its Christmas but I believe there are like 5 or 6 days between that. And do you mean with him? If he doesn't have a good reason, would you still think about seeing him? Personally, I would say adios as any type of relationship figure and keep him around as a friend if you still want something from him, but most I consider friends wouldn't stand me up without at least a call.....thats jmo.

I have to wait till New Year's because I live a few hours away. I have no friends where I live, plus I'll have no one to watch the kiddo.
