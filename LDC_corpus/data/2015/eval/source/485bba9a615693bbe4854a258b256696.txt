BOSTON  The American Unitarian Association, peopled and powered by this citys Brahmin elite, announced its presence here in 1886 with a grand and stately headquarters at the very top of Beacon Hill, right next door to the Statehouse.

If anyone doubted the denominations might, its next move made it clear: In 1927, strapped for space, the Unitarians finished building a new home next to the capitol on the other side, even persuading the legislature to change the streets numbering so they could take their address with them.

But the Unitarian Universalist Association, as the denomination is now known, is selling its headquarters building, as well as two grand homes and an office building it owns in the same neighborhood. It is leaving behind the red brick sidewalks, gas streetlamps and superrich neighbors for a section of South Boston the city has designated an innovation district, home to up-and-coming technology and arts businesses.

The move  expected to bring tens of millions of dollars to the denomination  puts the Unitarians in increasingly familiar company. Multiple religious denominations, citing everything from diminished financial resources to a need for more contemporary office space, are simultaneously downsizing and raising money by selling longtime headquarters in expensive neighborhoods. The moves come at a time when increasing secularization in the United States is taking a toll on many religious institutions, although most say the reasons for their relocations are not solely financial.

1. This is sad Sad because it's the liberal mainline denominations that are bleeding people and resources. The fundie wacko denominations have lots of money, their people have 3 or 4 kids a pop, and they aren't going anywhere.

3. Some of this seems to be more of a reorganization than a downsizing. On a cross country road trip last year, I saw lots of those big mega-churches that had been abandoned as well.

Times are changing and those that are able to adapt may survive. I wouldn't bet against the UU's at this point. I think they have an appeal to the "nones" and may, in fact, experience some growth in the next few years.

But we shall see.

2. My parish is requesting to build more on it's property. We are a lucky parish because we have many assets.

4. You are also the member of a progressive church and I think they are going to do better in the long run, as younger people look for fresher alternatives.

I wish I could be there today but I have a cold.

6. Ah, take care of yourself. I had a whopper 2 weeks ago and am left with this horrible hacking cough.

Chicken soup? There must be a good deli nearby.

9. The good news is the more colds you have now, the less you will have in the future.

Best to get them out of the way while you are young and healthy.

8. Beacon Hill -&gt; South Boston is quite a move. Might be a good one overall. I hear part of Southie has changed a lot with a high tech area, younger residents, etc. UU may be moving from their past to their future.

10. I think they are showing some shrewd thinking here and agree with your take on the move.
