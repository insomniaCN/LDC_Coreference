Whoa geeze, I'm not getting a warm and fuzzy feeling that he's going to be greeted with open arms.

From the BBC:

Slap in the face'

On Tuesday Palestinian protesters gathered in Ramallah and Bethlehem, some throwing shoes at images of the president and others driving over his portrait, reports said.

Demonstrator Huwaida Arraf told Reuters news agency that Mr Obama's visit was "a slap in the face".

"People are angry and disappointed that this far into his presidency, Obama has done nothing, and aid to Israel's occupation continues to flow," he said.

Meanwhile, Israeli demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem to demand Mr Obama free Jonathan Pollard, imprisoned in the US in 1987 for spying for Israel.

"Let my people go," said one banner.
