Associated Press= WASHINGTON (AP)  President Barack Obama's nominee to take over the federal health care agency  and assume responsibility for his health care overhaul  is making her first appearance before senators who will help decide her confirmation.

Sylvia Mathews Burwell was to testify Thursday before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, the first of two Senate committees that will hold hearings on her nomination.

Burwell is Obama's choice to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who resigned last month after presiding over the passage of the health law and the disastrous rollout of the federal enrollment website. Sebelius left just as the law had begun to recover with stronger-than-expected sign-up numbers.

Burwell is seen as a safe pick, not least because she was unanimously confirmed by the Senate last year as Obama's budget director.
