Hello fellow brothers and sisters in Christ,

Lately, there has been a lot of negative discussion about whether remarriage is a sin or not. I would like this thread to be one of powerful testimonies of God's grace and mercy of which God has blessed many of us who have divorced and remarried.

Personally speaking, remarriage has been a blessing for me. I have been divorced and remarried. My first husband was a manic depressive who threatened to kill himself and me because he was unemployed. I divorced him shortly afterwards. Since then, I have been remarried to a man of twelve years now. God has shown me nothing but mercy, love and compassion. He has blessed me in every area of my life (marriage, finances, business success, wealth, beauty, happiness, spiritually, sexually). There are numerous of other blessings that would be too long to list in this thread.

Have I felt God's wrath, judgment and punishment? No. Have I learned a lot about marriage and God? Definitely! When I was a younger Christian (in my mid-twenties), I was of the belief that God was a God of punishment and laws. However, as my faith in God grew stronger and as I spiritually matured, I (now at 41 years old) realize and understand God's heart to be full of compassion, forgiveness and love. I want to encourage all of those who have remarried and are struggling. If you draw closer to God, God will bless you and never leave you. With God, all things are possible.

I praise God everyday and will be forever grateful for His love for me. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/bow.gif"/> <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/clap.gif"/>

For all you happy-remarried folks out there, please share your testimonies so that we can encourage those who need encouragement and uplift their spirits. What an awesome God we have!! God bless you all. <img src="http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/angel.gif"/>
