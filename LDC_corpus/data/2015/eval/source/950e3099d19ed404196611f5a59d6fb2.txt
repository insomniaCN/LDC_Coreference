Budget:

Even before sequestration hits, the administration has been releasing hundreds of illegal aliens scheduled for deportation, jeopardizing public safety in a demagogic attempt to scare us into not cutting spending.

'I'm appalled to learn the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has begun to release hundreds of illegal aliens from custody, the first of potentially thousands to soon be freed under the guise of federal budget cuts," said Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer on Tuesday in response to the release by Immigration and Customs Enforcement of hundreds of "low-risk" illegal aliens from detention.

Well, so are we.

We are appalled at the bogus warnings that our food supply will be tainted, our transportation security jeopardized and the like by slowing the rate of growth by the federal behemoth by a paltry $85 billion.

And now this  the release of criminal illegal aliens before sequestration even happens is a cynical and unnecessary political ploy. In Pinal County, 70 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, Sheriff Paul Babeau told Newsmax, the release of hundreds of detainees over the weekend was "outrageous and unacceptable, because there's a direct and immediate impact to public safety of families in my county."

Babeau noted: "These are criminal illegals. They were headed for deportation  but now, they have received a budget pardon."

An ICE spokesman said the detainees selected for release were "noncriminals and other low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal histories."

Well, that depends on how you define "low risk" and "serious." We view all crime as serious and law enforcement and border security as an essential, not optional, function of government.

American businesses across the board have had to streamline and budget in order to survive.
And most have survived. Sure they've laid off employs, but they've also become more efficient at what they do in order to keep their heads above water.

This is smoke and mirrors, honk and jive, dog and pony.

Bless the Republicans for standing up to this sorry excuse that continues to defame the most prestigeous Office in the land.

In one of the most politically despicable moves ever perpetrated by a sitting administration, federal immigration officials have released hundreds of illegal aliens from prison in anticipation of budget cuts produced by the sequester. As fiscal uncertainty remains over the continuing resolution and possible sequestration, ICE has reviewed its detained population to ensure detention levels stay within ICEs current budget, said agency spokeswoman Gillian M. Christensen in a statement. Immigration officials further warned that even more releases are possible, if the anticipated cuts are realized.

In Arizona, Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu, who revealed that more than 500 inmates were released in his county alone, put this ploy in the proper perspective. President Obama would never release 500 criminal illegals to the streets of his hometown, yet he has no problem with releasing them in Arizona. The safety of the public is threatened and the rule of law discarded as a political tactic in this sequester battle, he said.

Words can't illustrate how ****ing low this ******* will stoop. Punish your enemies by releasing violent criminals to terrorize the public. One can only imagine how much more damage this country will have to absorb over the next 4 years (and probably beyond).

That is a dirty damn lie. They are not criminals. The only crime they are guilty of is entering the country illegally. Being detained is not the same as being convicted of a crime and imprisoned.

Many illegal immigrants released from detention centers
ICE won't say how many people are out or where they took place, but immigration advocacy groups say illegal immigrants were freed from Alabama lockups. The cases against the immigrants haven't been dropped; ICE officials say they are on supervised release. ICE says the detainees released are low-risk offenders who do not have serious criminal records. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill feel blind-sided.
