Recent elections in Latin America continue that regions remarkable surge toward democracy and away from the clutches of U.S. imperialism. On December 14, moderate socialist Michelle Bachelet was elected president of Chile while Camila Vallejo, revolutionary leader of the 2011 student rebellion, was elected to Congress.

In Venezuela, the ruling United Socialist Party of President Nicolas Maduro and the late Hugo Chavez won a majority of races held last month. The victory came despite ongoing efforts by reactionaries to undermine the Venezuelan economy and destabilize the advances of the Bolivarian Revolution. Violence by oppositionists is on the upswing and a repeat of the 2002 military coup attempt that temporarily deposed Chavez, only to be repulsed by a popular uprising, is a distinct possibility.

In Honduras, meanwhile, Juan Orlando Hernandez of the reactionary National Party won the presidency over LIBRE candidate Xiomara de Castro in a November 24 election marred by massive fraud. Altered ballots, vote-buying, intimidation and election-day violence by the military, paramilitary squads and others allied with the NP were widespread and witnessed by hundreds of international observers. The fraudulent vote came on the heels of the pre-election murders of several hundred journalists, human rights workers, LIBRE candidates and other critics of the outgoing regime of the NPs Porfirio Lobo Sosa.

Nowhere are people moving forward as they are in South and Central America. That is significant for us because democracy is contagious and when global movements become strong enough, it can spread even to the most unlikely of places  the United States, say. In addition, successful resistance to empire brings us closer to the day when we can finally shed the baggage of domination and exploitation and begin to relate to people around the world in something approximating peace and harmony. For these and other reasons we should take note of, and even take notes on, developments to our south.
