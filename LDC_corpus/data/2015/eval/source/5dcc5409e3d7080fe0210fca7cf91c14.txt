<quote>
The number of police officers injured during loyalist protests against a republican parade in central Belfast is 56.

The police fired 26 plastic bullets and made eight arrests on Friday evening amid sustained rioting in Royal Avenue.

Northern Ireland's Chief Constable Matt Baggott described the violence as "mindless anarchy" and "thuggery".

He praised his officers, saying they had put their lives on the line to protect the rule of law.

"I want to, as ever, commend my colleagues for their immense courage last night. I have no doubt whatsoever that they prevented that anarchy from spreading and without that courage, many lives may well have been lost," Mr Baggott said.

Officers hospitalised
He added that those who attacked police had "no intention of peaceful protest".

It is disgraceful that this level of violence is still happening in 2013. My prayers are for peace in Northern Ireland, and I hope the parades and protests tomorrow go on without incident.

I support peaceful protest, better to take a police beating then to make it appear the protest was violent.
Propaganda wise, it makes the protest group look so much better, and makes police look like vial criminals.
Not saying that happened here.
"Move on" wallstreet protests:
Riots by participants- Wall street protest is a violent group, police need to quell the uprising.
Police beating protestors who sit and take it- cops are terrible and the protestors are determined to be heard.

Both were incidents by the same group, but both had very different outcomes. (I use the wallstreet protest as an example, not to derail the thread)
