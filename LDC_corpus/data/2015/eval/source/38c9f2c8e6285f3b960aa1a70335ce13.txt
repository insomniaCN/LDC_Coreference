Lawsuit: Ga. farmer discriminated against workers

<a href="http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/15624530/lawsuit-ga-farmer-discriminated-against-workers">Lawsuit: Ga. farmer discriminated against workers - CBS Atlanta 46</a>

A lawsuit accuses a South Georgia farmer of discriminating against U.S. and black workers because of their race and national origin while giving better treatment to workers from Mexico.

The suit filed last week by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission seeks compensation on behalf of ex-workers at Hamilton Growers Inc. in Norman Park. A company attorney said she could not immediately comment.

It alleges that the firm in 2009 let go the bulk of its U.S. workers but kept nearly all of its 370 workers from Mexico. The next year, lawyers say the company terminated the majority of its 233 U.S. workers, but it kept the vast majority of its 518 workers from Mexico.

The lawsuit also says that black workers got fewer hours and were forced into less-lucrative work.

This must be joke because Americans do not want to do back breaking, sweaty and dirty farm work ?Farmers will hire children of illegal aliens and pay them less than what their parents are paid for the same amount of work. 6 bushels picked by a child is paid less than 5 bushels picked by their father. We all know why farmers want illegal alien workers.
