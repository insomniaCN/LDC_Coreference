Vince Young, the former University of Texas and NFL quarterback from Houston who has been involved in a pair of lawsuits stemming from financial issues that arose during the 2011 NFL lockout, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Attorney Brian Kilmer of Houston filed the petition last week in a Houston federal bankruptcy court on Youngs behalf, listing Young with estimated assets between $500,001 and $1 million and liabilities between $1,001,000 and $10 million. No specific details on Youngs assets and liabilities were immediately available.

Over the last year, Young, 30, has been locked in a pair of lawsuits stemming from a $1.8 million loan obtained in his name during the 2011 lockout.

A New York state court has granted a judgment against Young to Pro Player Funding, a New York company that made the loan, which along with interest has grown to more than $2.5 million, according to a Pro Player attorney.
