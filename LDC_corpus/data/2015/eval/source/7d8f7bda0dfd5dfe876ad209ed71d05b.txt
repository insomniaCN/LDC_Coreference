JAKARTA, Indonesia  Growing up in a conservative Muslim household in rural West Sumatra, Alexander Aan hid a dark secret beginning at age 9: He did not believe in God. His feelings only hardened as he got older and he faked his way through daily prayers, Islamic holidays and the fasting month of Ramadan.

He stopped praying in 2008, when he was 26, and he finally told his parents and three younger siblings that he was an atheist  a rare revelation in a country like Indonesia, the worlds most populous Muslim-majority nation. They responded with disappointment and expressions of hope that he would return to Islam.

But Mr. Aan neither returned to Islam nor confined his secret to his family, and he ended up in prison after running afoul of a 2008 law restricting electronic communications. He had joined an atheist Facebook group started by Indonesians living in the Netherlands, and in 2011 he began posting commentaries outlining why he did not think God existed.

When I saw, with my own eyes, poor people, people on television caught up in war, people who were hungry or ill, it made me uncomfortable, Mr. Aan, now 32, said in an interview. What is the meaning of this? As a Muslim, I had questioned God  what is the meaning of God? He was released on parole on Jan. 27 after serving more than 19 months on a charge of inciting religious hatred.

1. I understand FoxNews is going to start making a big deal about the persecution of atheists.

2. I don't understand this comment at all. What does it have to do with a NYT story on the persecution of atheists?
