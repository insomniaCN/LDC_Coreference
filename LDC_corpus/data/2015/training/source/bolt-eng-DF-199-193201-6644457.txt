Found on the web.

True or not, this is destined to become a classic â€¦.

This was on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Jay went into the
audience to find the most embarrassing first date that a woman ever had.
The winner described her worst first date experience. There was absolutely no question as to why her tale took the prize!

Marilyn said it was midwinter...snowing and quite cold...and the guy
had taken her skiing to Lake Arrowhead. It was a day trip (no overnight).
Oh no, not Marilyn. She was a good girl. They were strangers, after all,
and truly had never met before.

The outing was fun but relatively uneventful until they were headed home late that afternoon. They were driving back down the mountain when she gradually began to realize that she should not have had that extra latte.

They were about an hour away from anywhere with a rest room and in the middle of nowhere! Her companion suggested she try to hold it, which she did for a while.

Unfortunately, because of the heavy snow and slow going, there came a point where she told him that he had better stop and let her pee beside the road, or it would be the front seat of his car.

They stopped and she quickly crawled out beside the car, yanked her pants down and started. Unfortunately, in the deep snow she didn't have
good footing, so she let her butt rest against the rear fender to steady
herself. Her companion stood on the side of the car watching for traffic and indeed was a real gentleman and refrained from peeking.

All she could think about was the relief she felt despite the rather embarrassing nature of the situation. Upon finishing however, she soon
became aware of another sensation. As she bent to pull up her pants, the young lady discovered her buttocks were firmly glued against the car's fender.

Thoughts of tongues frozen to pump handles immediately came to mind as she attempted to disengage her flesh from the icy metal. It was quickly apparent that she had a brand new problem due to the extreme cold.

Horrified by her plight and yet aware of the humor she answered her date's concerns about "what was taking so long" with a reply that indeed, she was "freezing her butt off and needed some assistance"! He came around the car as she tried to cover herself with her sweater and then, as she looked imploringly into his eyes, he burst out laughing. She too, got the giggles and when they finally managed to compose themselves, they assessed her dilemma.

Obviously, as hysterical as the situation was, they also were faced with a real problem. Both agreed it would take something hot to free her chilly cheeks from the grip of the icy metal! Thinking about what had gotten her into the predicament in the first place, both quickly realized that there was only one way to get her free so, as she looked the other way, her first time date proceeded to unzip his pants and pee her butt off the fender.

As for the Tonight Show...she took the prize hands down...or perhaps
that should be "pants down." And you thought your first date was
embarrassing. This gives a whole new meaning to being "pissed off.

A girlfriend told me this many years ago. It seems that her friend had used a tampon, and the she could not get to the string to remove it. So she went to the emergency room. There was a young resident on duty, who took care of her problem. The way my girlfriend told the story,

"The resident saw what he liked, and liked what he saw, and they were soon married"!

Husker:

Was she related to the highschool girl with the bra padded with wire, who "shorted" herself on the butter machine at the movies? Boy, that current sure did move fast! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil"/>
