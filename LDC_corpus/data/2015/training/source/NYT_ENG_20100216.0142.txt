WITH TAKEOVER BID, SIMON AIMS TO CONTROL 30 PERCENT OF U.S. MALLS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After months of speculation, the Simon Property Group on Tuesday
finally made an unsolicited $10 billion offer for General Growth
Properties, its bankrupt rival. But General Growth quickly rebuffed
the approach, calling the bid too low.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the move would make Simon the biggest mall
operator in the country, controlling about 30 percent of malls in
the United States, according to analysts from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
Merging the two companies, whose portfolios are roughly the same
size, would also unite two of the most well-known names in the
business.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Simon late Tuesday, General Growth's chief
executive, Adam Metz, said that he would welcome discussions within
the confines of the bankruptcy process.
</P>
<P>
"We and our board of directors have given considerable thought
to your indication of interest and have concluded based on
discussions with other interested parties that it is not sufficient
to pre-empt the process we are undertaking to explore all avenues
to emerge from Chapter 11 and maximize value for all the Company's
stakeholders," Metz said.
</P>
<P>
A merger would allow General Growth to finally remove itself
from a 10-month, complicated Chapter 11 case. Begun 56 years ago as
a shopping center in Iowa, General Growth grew to be one of the
nation's biggest mall companies, operating prized malls like the
Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, only to run aground because of debt
troubles after acquiring the Rouse Co. for $12.6 billion in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Simon is regarded by analysts as one of the best-managed mall
operators in the business.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, Simon has been building up its war chest to
prepare for acquisitions to take advantage of depressed commercial
real estate prices, with General Growth squarely in its sights. It
said on Tuesday that its offer would be largely financed by its
cash on hand and existing credit agreements.
</P>
<P>
Simon's move is meant to pre-empt General Growth's own plan to
emerge from bankruptcy, which may include financial help from
another mall operator, Brookfield Asset Management, that owns some
of its unsecured debt.
</P>
<P>
Simon is portraying its offer as speeding General Growth's exit
from Chapter 11 by paying off $7 billion in unsecured debt in full
and in cash and by assuming about $21 billion in secured debt.
Under the terms of its proposal, Simon would pay about $6 a share
in cash. It would also distribute ownership in General's planned
community development, valued at about $3 a share.
