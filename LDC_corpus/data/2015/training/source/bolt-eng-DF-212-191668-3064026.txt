Chinese migrants clash with Italian police in Milan's Chinatown district
The riot broke out after a Chinese woman was given a traffic fine
Italian riot police have broken up a violent protest in Milan's Chinatown by scores of Chinese immigrants.

About 10 police officers were injured and a similar number of Chinese people received hospital treatment.

The trouble began when a Chinese woman was fined for illegally transporting goods in a private vehicle.

More than 100 Chinese shopkeepers and members of their families, many waving the national flag, massed in the street claiming racial discrimination.

Everyone these days are on a short fuse!

If fining the person for illegal transportation is the only reason, then it is hardly a ground to claim racial discrimination.

What does the Chinese media say on this, if it has reported it.

wow, AFAIK this is prolly the only time where the Chinese immigrants rioted in a foreign country. Ofcourse there are lots of notorious asian gangs, but never regular shop keepers.

Italian police clash with Chinese merchants in Milan's Chinatown

Italian police clashed with Chinese merchants over traffic control in Milan's busy Chinatown Thursday, with several people injured on both sides, witnesses reported.

Hundreds of Chinese merchants staged a protest in the Via Paolo Sarpi area after police fined a pregnant Chinese woman over the use of a barrow to deliver goods.

The clash broke out when riot police were called in to stop the Chinese protesters who were holding up slogans for "commercial rights" and against "police brutality."

Chinese Consul General to Milan Zhang Limin told Xinhua that all the General Consulate staff rushed to the scene to help defuse the tension.

He said the Chinese diplomats urged the protesters to keep restraint and avoid causing the situation to deteriorate. They also visited the injured in hospital.

Meanwhile, the Chinese consul general pointed out that the incident was not an isolated case. During the past two months the Chinese merchants have become increasingly unhappy with the police, who they claim fine them at will or confiscate their goods as part of punitive measures to limit the use of barrows.

The General Consulate is closely following the situation and has requested an urgent meeting with Milan mayor Letizia Moratti.

I had my doubt about the whole story because no sane person would claim racial discrimination over being fined by the police for some minor illegal act!

Another instance of motivated reporting that is the trademark of the media worldwide!

Thanks

This is a rare event, I still find it surprising that it was Chinese people who rioted. If they were claiming racial discrimination then there must be more of a reason then a woman getting a fine. I guess that incident was a trigger for something else.
