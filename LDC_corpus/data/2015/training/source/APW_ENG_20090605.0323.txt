One of Australia's most experienced lawmakers was appointed Friday to replace the defense minister who resigned after failing to distance himself from his brother's business dealings with the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that Secretary of State John Faulkner would become the next defense minister a day after his predecessor Joel Fitzgibbon quit.
</P>
<P>
One of Faulkner's first official duties will be to represent Australia at a NATO summit in Brussels next week.
</P>
<P>
Faulkner is one of only three members of Rudd's government, which was elected in 2007, who had been ministers when the Labor Party was last in power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Sen. Faulkner is a man of great character and great integrity and one of the most experienced and accomplished ministers in Cabinet," Rudd told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbon is the first minister in the current government to quit or be fired so his departure gives Rudd an opportunity to make wider changes to the 18-month-old Cabinet line up.
</P>
<P>
Rudd said he would announce further changes within days.
</P>
<P>
Trouble-prone Fitzgibbon resigned after an army general responsible for defense health services told the Senate in a routine inquiry Wednesday that he had met in Fitzgibbon's office last year with ministerial staff and the minister's brother, Mark Fitzgibbon, who was representing U.S. health insurer Humana. Defense contracts were discussed but none were signed.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbon wrote in his resignation letter that he had avoided being a part of the negotiations to ensure he had no conflict of interest as a minister. But he decided to resign "to protect the integrity of the government," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Fitzgibbon -- who will remain in the government as a junior lawmaker -- has embarrassed the government in the past by failing to declare gifts that he had received.
