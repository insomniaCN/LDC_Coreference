My friend and i have suddenly grown closer over the past two years, and we have now become BEST FRIENDS. shes the friend i had never had. and im not ashamed to say that i love her as a mate, we talk, we laugh and we have fun, shes a lovely girl..BUT.
about a year ago she started talking about this guy, and then another, and then another. she likes to think theyre all her "boyfriends" but actually they all just send dirty texts to one another, every time we talk its like: its mine and "his" anniversary, im giving him my virginity!!" and theyre not even friends on facebook. i get the feeling he doesnt even know her last name..
Then she met "x" a guy whos slightly older, and has had a disturbed,dangerous and probably highly illegal past. theyve become very close and all of a sudden shes acting "bad" pretending to have a smoking habbit, telling me she used to smoke before, when she didn't. she clearly lies about "NEEDING" a fag, its obvious, just because "x" smokes.
i think she thrives off being bad, because all she ever talks about is: plannin to have sex with her "boyfriend" while her parents are out of the house. or smoking in the garden so her parents dont find out...
why is she acting all bad, all of a sudden? why cant she just grow up? its like she wants attention or something? its not impressing me and it doesnt make me jealous, so why does she do it?

Shes into bad boys because of course she tries to fit in.. Simply because its cool to smoke - Yeah it really is cool to smoke isn't it? Thats how i started, Simply because in college while i was doing my diploma in music.. I saw this hot girl by the smoking shelter(area) and i thought to get into a conversation, i'd have to start smoking to become friends with her.... I think you friend is doing the same thing because like i said ''Trying to fit in'' Nevertheless, its stupid, although i dont regret what i've done.. as I only smoke on social occasions. However what your friend is doing is a little childish. I suggest you slap her, tell her to grow the heck up..

Seems like it makes you worry unduly about her, so she's achieved something. Sad fact is, it's very unlikely she'll come back to how she was through your input.
