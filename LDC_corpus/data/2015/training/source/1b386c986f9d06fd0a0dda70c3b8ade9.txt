drug lord handed maximum sentence
A US judge sentences Christopher 'Dudus' Coke to 23 years in prison.

The US government pressure Jamaican military to shoot up a neighbourhood and arrest a drug lord for trading in an industry the US itself creates poor market conditions for, but still openly trade in. Dudus is then extradited and tried in a US court.

If the US pressured the Jamaican government to capture and extradite him, then it was Jamaica that arrested and imprisoned him, not the US. Try to argue that all you want, it is the facts. He committed crimes in the US [orchestrating drug trafficking and illegal weapons deals on US soil], which means he is liable to be tried in the US.

Given the facts of the case, which Al Jazeera even put out pretty plainly, I don't see how you can make a claim that the US has arrested anyone or imprisoned anyone, when he was arrested by Jamaican police and extradited to the US. That is how international law cooperation works - if you want a prisoner arrested that is not in your country, you ask them to arrest that person and have them extradited.

In the same way it would have been a Soviet satellite arresting a dissident with the Kremlin pressuring them.

Did he enter the US? No? Then he didn't commit crimes in the US.

Where, as a foreign-national, he was tried under US law and jailed for crimes the US government routinely conduct themselves on a much grander scale.

For a great many things yes. In the case of commodity shipping - I'd say no. Unless countries with total weapon bans are free to pressure the US military to shoot up Hartford, Connecticut and arrest Colt CEOs.

Criminalising commodities internationally and then rounding up foreign nationals is grossly immoral. Control your border and employ all the domestic laws you want. Source country control, as its known in the technical literature, is criminal.

So, it would be legal for me to smuggle, and profit from smuggling gold into India if I did so through employing surrogates?

Smuggling drugs and guns isn't legal. This is about powerful states exerting their will on foreign populations.

In the example India would have no right to ship military aid to your country, demand the government carry out a proxy gun fight and arrest you to extradite you to India for a prison stint. Especially if India set the global market conditions for gold and had previously committed the crime they are charging you with, smuggling said gold.

Why not? Who decides when a country is out of line when enforceing their laws?

If Jamaca is game for it, the agreement between the two countries seems valid.

India as a culture has and India has indeed set market conditions that caused smuggleing gold into India to be profitable by putting a 4% import tariff on it.

Would it be OK for India to go out of their way to have me arrested and extradited to them if I was circumbventing their laws by hireing surrogates to smuggle massive ammounts of gold into their country?

When they enforce them outside their own country.

Which would ignore the history and power relations of the region.

So it should control its borders and persecute criminals within its national sovereignty.

Not any more ok than it would be to attack the US because COLT products end up in tight gun control countries.

You mean have the US attack itself willingly? If they could get the US to do that they might have a compelling case.
