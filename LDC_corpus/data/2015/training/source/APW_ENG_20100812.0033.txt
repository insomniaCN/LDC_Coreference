An Iraqi man was convicted of people smuggling after a jury determined he had helped hundreds of asylum seekers reach Australia by boat.

Hadi Ahmadi, who in 2009 became the first person extradited to Australia from Indonesia on people smuggling charges, was found guilty in the Western Australia state District Court in Perth on Wednesday. He could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.

He had pleaded not guilty to charges that he helped smuggle more than 900 asylum seekers on four boats from Indonesia to Australia over six months in 2001. The jury found him guilty of helping organize two of those boats.

Australia is increasingly targeted by asylum seekers from the Middle East and Asia who often fly to Indonesia then pay people smugglers to ship them in rickety boats to Australian islands in the Indian Ocean.

Prosecutors told the court that Ahmadi had been working for a leading Indonesian people smuggler, Achmad Olong. Olong is serving a five-year prison term in Australia after being extradited from Thailand in 2007 and pleading guilty to smuggling 353 people to Australia.

Ahmadi's attorney, Jonathan Davies, said Ahmadi was a refugee who had fled Iraq and had not been paid to help his fellow asylum seekers.
