The parliament of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) elected on
Thursday six new members to its executive body.
</P>
<P>
Among the six elected are Ahmed Qorei, a veteran who recently lost his position
in the leadership of the secular Fatah movement, along with top negotiator Saeb
Erakat, and lawmaker Hanan Ashrawi, a PLO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council (PNC), the organisation's parliament, last held
a plenary meeting in 1996, and was replacing members of the PLO's 18-member
Executive Committee who have since died.
</P>
<P>
Among Executive Committee members who died in recent years was iconic
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who passed away in 2004 in a Paris hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee is headed by Palestinian Authority president Mahmud
Abbas.
</P>
<P>
The PLO groups the main Palestinian nationalist factions, including Abbas's
Fatah, but not the Islamist Hamas which has ruled the Gaza enclave since 2007.
</P>
<P>
It created the Palestinian Authority in July 1994 when Arafat returned to
Palestinian land after 27 years in exile.
</P>
<P>
The international community recognises the PLO as the "sole and legitimate"
representative of the Palestinian people, but Hamas disputes that claim and has
in the past sought to create a rival body.
