Excerpt:
South Carolina's first lady, who helped launch her husband's political career, filed for divorce Friday more than five months after his tearful public confession of an affair with an Argentine woman."This came after many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation, yet I am still dedicated to keeping the process that lies ahead peaceful for our family," Jenny Sanford said in a statement. In a statement, the governor blamed himself and said he and Jenny will "work earnestly to be the best mom and dad we can be to four of the finest boys on earth." - <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091211/ap_on_re_us/us_sc_governor">Link</a>

"Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, gave a nearly $14,000 pay raise to a female staffer in 2008, at the time he was becoming romantically involved with her, and later that year took her on a taxpayer-funded trip to Southeast Asia and the Middle East, though foreign policy was not her specialty."

If I was her I would have hit the road a long time ago. Guess she isn't going to be like Hillary Clinton and stick around for whatever political clout she can harvest off of the relationship.

She's the smartest one I've seen in a long time. She said there is no way she would have stood next to him while he confessed. I don't know why these women do this.
