If you don't care about this thread then don't post. It's quite simple really.
Learn the meaning of "troll" before you use it in a sentence.
Learn the meaning of "limelight" before you use it in a sentence.

I read the title as 'Bear Grylls Fried :(' for some reason. I thought he might have got lost in the Sahara Desert and run out of urine to drink or something. <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/dontknow.gif" alt=":dontknow:"/>

"In 2008, he apologised for misleading viewers for an episode which saw him supposedly abandoned in the wilderness - a programme consultant later claimed he had stayed in a motel."

How was anyone dumb enough to believe the rubbish he says about being lost etc anyway.

This is what happens when people believe everything they are told by the media.
