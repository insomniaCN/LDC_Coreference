How to get over a guy when he's in my class at uni...Embarassment/abortion
</headline>

We were seeing eachother for 9 months, i was in love with him whilst he didn't want a relationship with me or even care about my feelings. I know he liked other girls and was sleeping with them too whist we had our thing. He came to mine drunk after a night out, we had sex again, he left straight after... We ended up having a argument via text about feelings etc, he made it clear that he want interested anymore but I find it hard to let my feelings go and told him so. A week later, I found out that I was pregnant, we were both devastated and he messaged me everyday saying that he would support me on the abortion etc, after the abortion I was up-set and my feelings for him grew even more which pushed him away and caused more arguments. 2 days after I saw him in a club kissing another girl, he i then gnored my texts and decided that it's best not to meet up again. Meanwhile, he's in my classes at uni, I saw him and tried to speak but he wasn't really interested but I hung around, later him and his friend were going to do some coursework at his, I live near so I went with them, he asked me 'where are you going, your not coming back to mine...' I didn't think he was being fully serious, but it turns out he was... things are messy between us, he texted a few days ago saying that he wished I would leave it with him and move on and that he was seeing another girl that night. He now ignores my texts and has threatened to block my number. Everytime my phone bleeps with a text I get disappointed it's not him, so today I changed my number and didn't give it to him... This situation is also affecting my studies, Im obsessed with my image for going into uni (because he's there) and now I've took time off and went home because Im ashamed of how I've acted whilst he's been rejecting me, all of his friends in our class thinks pretty bad of me, somewhere along the lines of an obsessive psycho. I can't get over this guy, I can tell my friends are bored when I discuss him over and over again, I need advice!

I'm sorry about what you've been through and it doesn't sound like he's been particuarly understanding or supportive about it but basically you need to forget about this guy and get on with your life.

You made a good move by changing your number now you need to concentrate on living a life independent of what this guy does or thinks. It is only fair that you let him get on with his own life as well, you were never in a relationship and although he may have treated you badly you can't keep interfering with his life when he is trying to move on. He is irrelevant to your life and you need to move on from what has happened and not necessarily find someone else but find some thing else to focus on. Never let a man define you.

Sorry to hear everything that's happened to you <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/hugs.gif" alt=":hugs:"/> He really really doesn't sound like a very nice guy though, if he moved on that quickly after you having the abortion, then he really can't have been as supportive as he'd said he would be. I can only imagine how tough that must've been for you to go through, and really, he should have supported you more.

Anyway, you need to move on, even though he sounds like an idiot, everything between you is in the past now. I know it's tough when you're in the same class and it definitely makes it harder to distance him from your mind, but it's something you're going to have to do, he's not worth it anyway. Try and keep busy, go out with your friends, meet someone new, even just to prove to yourself that you can like someone else. Time is a great healer, you will meet someone else who you like as much as you liked him <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/>

He sounds like a total douche bag. You probably want to avoid him as much as possible.

You have sex with him, that's right, you will start having feeling for him? Why? This feeling will help you to tie him down so that your child can have a father.

He has been living this lifestyle before and after he meets you. That means you do not accept who he is, don't tell me you love him, no, you don't.

There are two ways: be a good girl and accept who he is, start seeing other guys while ****ing him as well, since you are officially in a poly relationship.

Move on, forget about him, **** other dudes.
