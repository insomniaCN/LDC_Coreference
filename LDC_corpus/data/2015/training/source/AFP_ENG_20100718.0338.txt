Kidnappers who abducted four journalists in Nigeria's oil-rich south a week ago
released them on Sunday without a ransom being paid, the head of the reporters'
union said.
</P>
<P>
"They put a call through to us saying that they have been released
unconditionally," said Nigerian Union of Journalists head Usman Leman.
</P>
<P>
Police met up with the Nigerian journalists after their release, Leman said, and
they were making their way out of a remote area in Abia State.
</P>
<P>
Kidnappings occur frequently in Nigeria's south, but oil workers have
traditionally been the victims.
</P>
<P>
The abduction of the journalists illustrated a widening of the target profiles
in recent months and sparked outrage across Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Officials and media rights groups, including global organisation Reporters
Without Borders, also called for their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappings were the second involving journalists in the volatile region
this year.
</P>
<P>
In March, three M-Net Supersport television crew members -- a South African and
two Nigerians -- were seized in Imo state, which neighbours the oil hub of
Rivers State. They were freed about a week later.
</P>
<P>
While many of the kidnappings of oil workers have been claimed by militants who
say they are seeking a fairer distribution of oil revenues, other abductions
have been carried out to collect cash through ransom payments.
