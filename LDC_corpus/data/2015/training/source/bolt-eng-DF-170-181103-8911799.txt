WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Barack Obama has granted the first pardons of his presidency, to nine people convicted of crimes including possessing drugs, counterfeiting and even mutilating coins.
No one well-known was on the list, and some of the crimes dated back decades or had drawn little more than a slap on the wrist in the first place - such as the Pennsylvania man sentenced in 1963 to probation and a $20 fine for mutilating coins. The White House didn't explain the charge, but tampering with federal currency is a crime.
The White House declined to give details on the cases or comment on why these particular people were selected by a president who previously had only pardoned Thanksgiving turkeys.

Am I alone in thinking a president should issue a statement explaining the reason for every pardon given? Why won't this president explain himself? I'm not saying whether these people should have been pardoned or not, just that whom a president chooses to pardon can tell us a lot about the president's character and what (s)he stands for. Why won't they address the question of why these individuals were chosen and pardoned by the president?

Other than in cases of impeachment, the power is without restriction. Article 2, Section 2:

<quote>
Section 2.

The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment...

I think it would be a good idea though. Clinton caught lots of flak for those last minute pardons.

I agreed with you. He does have the power and all of them, not just Obama, should give some reason why, IMO, though I'm pretty sure we'll never see an amendment on it.

I would wager that if one were to check carefully, these folks needed the pardon for a reason, employment maybe, vanity, who knows, and they reached out to their congresscritter, paid up and got moved to the top of the list and viola'. They all do it...

Even if we could get a written explanation for any and all pardons, we couldn't take them for any real value. Some speech writer would write them and 15 party people would approve them.

" Six years after the arms - for - hostages scandal began to cast a shadow that would darken two Administrations, President Bush today granted full pardons to six former officials in Ronald Reagan's Administration, including former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger.

Mr. Weinberger was scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 5 on charges that he lied to Congress about his knowledge of the arms sales to Iran and efforts by other countries to help underwrite the Nicaraguan rebels, a case that was expected to focus on Mr. Weinberger 's private notes that contain references to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/big/1224.html#article">Mr. Bush's endorsement of the secret shipments to Iran</a>.

In one remaining facet of the inquiry, the independent prosecutor, Lawrence E. Walsh, plans to review a 1986 campaign diary kept by Mr. Bush. Mr. Walsh has characterized the President 's failure to turn over the diary until now as misconduct. "

" The widely and justly criticized pardons of Caspar Weinberger and other Iran-Contra defendants by George Herbert Walker Bush should have been just the beginning of that story. Yet, for reasons best known to the incorruptible watchdogs of the Washington press corps, Poppy's self-interested mercy upon Weinberger instigated no searching examination of the other pardons granted by the departing president. Indeed, the final dozen pardons given by Bush -- including the unexplained release of a Pakistani heroin trafficker -- <a href="http://dir.salon.com/news/col/cona/2001/02/27/pardons/index.html">received virtually no coverage at all</a>.

I would go further. There should be no Presidential Pardons, commuting of sentences etc...ever. How this crazy privilege of office survived all these years is a sad chapter of American history.

Instead, there should be a separate panel of the 3 most senior members of the Supreme Court who decide upon pardons commutations, etc...

Why should he explain anything? The Constitution grants the president the unilateral power to pardon, and it should be used more often. The sad part of this is that Obama waited almost tow years, and then chose to pardon people who don't need it. He obviously chose them because none of these people would create any controversy at all, which tells me all I need to know about his character.

No, a pardon legally declares them not guilty, and restores all citizenship rights, including the right to bear arms, vote, and even serve in the military.

( That could also have appealed to " conservatives' " preference for some kind o' body-count. )

As I recall Bush actually pardoned himself from Iran contra, his pardon for ALL those involved was so broad.

the Bush pardon also brings into question how do you pardon someone not yet convicted? does a pardon mean they are guilty of what they are being pardoned for?

No, a pardon legally declares them not guilty, and restores all citizenship rights, including the right to bear arms, vote, and even serve in the military.

Not guilty of what? Most all of them had not even been charged with a crime, or even investigated.

1. exempt guilty party from punishment: to officially release from any, or any further, punishment somebody who has committed a crime or wrongdoing
2. forgive guilty party: to forgive somebody who has committed a crime or wrongdoing
3. excuse somebody for something impolite: to excuse an impolite act or a person committing one

The action of an executive official of the government that mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime.

The granting of a pardon to a person who has committed a crime or who has been convicted of a crime is an act of clemency, which forgives the wrongdoer and restores the person's Civil Rights. At the federal level, the president has the power to grant a pardon, and at the state level the governor or a pardon board made up of high-ranking state officials may grant it.

The power to grant a pardon derives from the English system in which the king had, as one of his royal prerogatives, the right to forgive virtually all forms of crimes against the crown. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution, in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, provided that the president "shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment." Throughout U.S. history the courts have interpreted this clause to give the president virtually unlimited power to issue pardons to individuals or groups and to impose conditions on the forgiveness.
