<P>
Judge Sonia Sotomayor was expected to win Senate confirmation as early as
Thursday as the first Hispanic US Supreme Court justice, in a major victory for
President Barack Obama.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old appeals court judge was to become the third woman to sit on the
bench that serves as the final arbiter of the US Constitution and is called upon
to decide bitter feuds on volatile issues like gun rights and abortion.
</P>
<P>
Support from all of Obama's Democratic allies and a handful of Republicans meant
the outcome was never seriously in doubt -- though the final days brought
increasingly harsh debate over the place of race in the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator James Inhofe took aim at Sotomayor's much-quoted comment that
she hoped a "wise Latina" judge could be a better judge than a white male, and
bluntly declared: "I consider that racist."
</P>
<P>
The only Hispanic Democratic senator, Robert Menendez, joined leaders of major
Latino groups to warn Republicans that they will "pay a price" in coming
elections for voting against the groundbreaking nomination.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Republicans will pay a price for saying 'no' to this judge," and
to Obama's policies in general, Menendez said in Spanish at a press conference
in the US Capitol.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban-American New Jersey lawmaker said "maybe less than 10" of the
chamber's 40 Republicans will vote to confirm Sotomayor, who is the daughter of
migrants from Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
Some Republicans have worried that opposition to Sotomayor may hurt the party
with Hispanic voters, who could play a decisive role in the 2010 mid-term
elections and the 2012 presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
"In last year's elections, the road to the White House in large part came
through the Latino community," said Menendez. "We need to know who is with us,
and who is not."
</P>
<P>
Hispanic Americans, who went about 2-to-1 for Obama over Republican Senator John
McCain in the 2008 White House race, do not vote as a bloc. And most -- more
than 60 percent -- are Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
But because the Hispanic sociological group is the fastest-growing US minority,
lawmakers are keen to try to line up support.
</P>
<P>
Janet Murguia, head of the top US Hispanic rights group National Council of La
Raza, said Sotomayor's nomination had galvanized and united the diverse Latino
population and cautioned Republicans about the coming vote.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Republican Party is at a crossroads with our Latino community," she
said. "This vote will matter and it will be long remembered."
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Kit Bond of Missouri announced he would vote for confirmation
even though he disagreed with her views, bringing to seven the number of
Republicans backing Sotomayor.
</P>
<P>
"I will support her, I'll be proud for her, the community she represents, and
the American Dream she shows is possible," he said. "I urge my colleagues to do
the same."
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Jon Kyl, his party's number two in the Senate, said that
while "every American should be proud that a Hispanic woman has been nominated,"
lawmakers "must evaluate Judge Sotomayor on her merits, not on the basis of her
ethnicity."
</P>
<P>
Republicans also underlined that Democrats blocked a vote to confirm a Hispanic
nominee, Miguel Estrada, to be an appeals court judge.
</P>
<P>
"Because he had been nominated by a Republican, Estrada got no points for his
compelling personal story," said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senators Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd could be no-shows at the vote
because of health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a CNN poll released Wednesday found that 51 percent of US respondents
favored Sotomayor being approved. Thirty-six percent opposed her appointment and
14 percent had no opinion.
