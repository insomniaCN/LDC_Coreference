Engineer or Dancer?
Occupation Might Affect Divorce Chances.

<P>
If you marry the charming dancer who asks for your hand, are you more likely to
wind up in divorce court than if you'd picked the sensible engineer?
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the suggestion of a recent study that explores the correlation
of various occupations and rates of separation and divorce _ raising questions
about the way our careers can impact our personal lives.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in the spring edition of the Journal of Police and Criminal
Psychology, was co-written by Michael Aamodt, a professor emeritus at Radford
University who now works as a consultant with the Washington-based DCI
Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
At first, Aamodt wasn't interested in the romantic lives of either dancers or
engineers. Much of his academic career has been spent researching the
personalities of law enforcement officers. In previous studies Aamodt debunked a
myth about higher-than-average suicide rates among police officers and showed
that most cops have personality traits similar to those of other Americans.
</P>
<P>
Turning to their domestic lives, however, he found statistics about divorce
rates based on occupation hard to come by. Student Shawn McCoy, co-author of the
study, pressed Census officials to provide data that could be parsed to reveal
divorce and separation rates for Americans working in 449 jobs.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the 2000 Census, 16.35 percent of Americans who had previously
been married listed themselves as divorced or separated.
</P>
<P>
Only 14.5 percent of law enforcement officers who had been married said the
same. (The rates varied widely across the profession, though: Just 12.5 percent
of detectives were divorced, but 25.5 percent of fish and game wardens had
broken up with a spouse.)
</P>
<P>
Dancers and choreographers registered the highest divorce rates (43.1 percent),
followed by bartenders (38.4 percent) and massage therapists (38.2 percent).
Also in the top 10 were casino workers, telephone operators, nurses and home
health aides.
</P>
<P>
Three types of engineers _ agricultural, sales and nuclear engineers _ were
represented among the 10 occupations with the lowest divorce rates. Also
reporting low marital breakup rates were optometrists (4 percent), clergy (5.6
percent) and podiatrists (6.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
The numbers don't paint a complete picture. If a person had divorced and
remarried by the time of the Census, they would be counted as married. So it
could be that people in some occupations are just quicker to jump into the next
marriage than others.
</P>
<P>
The authors also point out that the data don't reveal whether it's the nature of
the jobs that lead to divorce, or if people prone to unstable relationships are
drawn to certain professions.
