CD1 and a WWGPD?

No 2012 baby for us, either. A lot of you already commiserated with me yesterday. Thank you for that, and please don't feel obligated to do it again. It just helps to get this stuff out.
AF arrived today. It was expected, but it still sucks. A lot. I called the RE's office and spoke with our nurse. I expressed wanting to take a break, and she was very understanding. She said a lot of couples opt to take a break because it is very stressful. She said to call back when we're ready again and we'll go through the next steps. I don't really want to, but I feel it's necessary for my sanity.
Anyways, I'm supposed to go to a baby shower for DH's second cousin (I think) on Sunday. The bitter part of me does not want to go. I've only met the girl a handful of times. MIL and most of DH's family are going, and I don't want to be the biotch that doesn't show up. I have no desire to ooooh and ahhhhh over a 19-year-old who made the conscious decision to get pregnant while living at her mom's and working part-time (she and her bf did plan this). Whatever, it's her right and I know it's just the jealous part of me talking.
DH is fine with me not going, but I have mixed feelings about it. I just don't know if I can handle all of the questions- "When it will be your turn, Starry?" that will inevitably be asked (as they always are).
So, WWGPD? Suck it up and go to the shower? Or find something more selfish to do for the day?

If you've only met her a few times don't feel bad. I probably wouldn't go.

I am a push-over when it comes to stuff like this so I would probably go. And when the "When are you going to be next?" question comes up, I would pointedly mention that today is not my day and that we are all here to celebrate X's pregnancy. Or you could always say that you and DH are practicing A LOT but you just found the right rhythm yet.

Good luck!

Hmmm, do you think people will ask a bunch of questions later if you don't go? If you don't think anyone will care/notice, then I say skip it.

I'd make up some excuse and not go. You can always send a gift off her registry if you feel guilty.

Even without having people dish out a bunch of questions, going to the baby shower of your DH's 2nd cousin who you've only met a couple times sounds brutal. I'd come up with an excuse and have DH drop the gift by MIL's house so she can take it with her. Wa-la!
