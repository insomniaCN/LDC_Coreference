TEHRAN - Iran Tuesday executed two men convicted of political crimes, one a
member of an armed opposition group and the other a spy for Israel, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency identified the alleged spy as Ali Akbar Siadat, saying he was
arrested in 2009 after having provided Israel with details on the number of
Iranian combat planes, military flights and the navigation systems of aircraft
belonging to the Revolutionary Guards. According to the report, Siadat met with
Israeli agents in Turkey, Thailand and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In 2008, Iran executed a communications specialist for allegedly providing
Israel with information.
</P>
<P>
The other man executed Tuesday had been in and out of prison for the past three
decades, accused of involvement with the Mujaheddin-e Khalq (MEK) organization,
a foreign-based opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
Family members told human rights groups that the man, Ali Saremi, had visited
the MEK in neighboring Iraq, but only to meet with his brother, who is a member
of the group.
</P>
<P>
The executions follow a rise in the number of political prisoners sentenced to
death in Iran recently, with authorities saying that most of those convicted
were endangering national security.
</P>
<P>
In January two men were hanged after being convicted of involvement in protests,
and in May, four Iranian Kurds and another man accused of terrorism were
executed. Family members have disputed the allegations.
