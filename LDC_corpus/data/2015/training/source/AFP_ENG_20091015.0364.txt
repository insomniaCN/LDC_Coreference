<P>
A Dutch judge on Thursday gave ailing bank DSB 24 hours to find a potential
buyer or face being declared bankrupt, a court document said.
</P>
<P>
"The court will give DSB the opportunity to indicate, by 12:00 (1000 GMT) on
Friday, whether a take-over is a real and achievable possibility in the very
short-term," said a written ruling by the district court in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
"If DSB reports back that a take-over is not possible, the court will declare it
bankrupt."
</P>
<P>
If a potential buyer is found, the court will hold a further hearing at 1200 GMT
on Friday to examine all the evidence in a bid by the bank's administrators to
have its affairs wound up.
</P>
<P>
DSB was placed under administration at the behest of the Dutch central bank
(DNB) on Monday, freezing all its activities and its clients' accounts.
</P>
<P>
Two independent administrators were appointed, who approached the court with an
application for bankruptcy after finding no willing buyers.
</P>
<P>
"I remain hopeful," the bank's chief executive Dirk Scheringa was reported by
Dutch news agency ANP as saying upon leaving the court late on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which has about 1,500 employees, has recently been in the news over
claims that it sold clients insurance policies they did not need and extended
mortgages they could not afford, prompting some to lodge claims for damages.
</P>
<P>
Account holders withdrew some 600 million euros in two weeks earlier this month,
about a sixth of the bank's deposits.
</P>
<P>
DSB bank, which recorded a net profit of 45.4 million euros (67 million dollars)
in 2008, says on its website that it holds 17 percent of the market for consumer
credit in the Netherlands. It has about 350,000 to 400,000 clients, including in
Belgium and Germany.
</P>
<P>
It is also the main sponsor of top Dutch football club AZ Alkmaar.
</P>
<P>
The government, which has promised an investigation, has announced that account
holders will be able to claim back up to 100,000 euros under a government
deposit guarantee system, to be administered by the DNB.
