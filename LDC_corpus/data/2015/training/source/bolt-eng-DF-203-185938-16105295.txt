ugh.. i just want to get over this.
my friend who is more than a friend, but not a boyfriend yet just went through a very bad time. he was in the hospital for literally 2 months due to stomach cancer. he just got out on frdiay and is at home now. i have not seen him yet, just received one e-mail calling me beautiful, telling me thank you for keeping him in touch with the outside world, and his goal now was to catch up on his life.
i just started the process to get a divorce from my husband who i have not seen in three years. my lawyer told me the worst case scenario: half his debt may be come mine and everything i have saved in order to some day get my own place may half be his. community property state. the car i paid off that he possesses and he has been slowly been paying me off? he may not have to pay that off anymore.
i was out today and i think i had a panic attack. i started crying and i couldn't stop myself. i drove myself home, laid down on the floor in my living room and just wailed. i just kept crying and moaning... i couldn't control it.
i'm scared. i know i'll be probably be just fine. but i'm really scared and really hurt and really lonely and i just feel like shyt right now.

the end

&lt;hugs&gt; Hang in there. Hopefully your lawyer will be able to keep your assets safe and prove how financially irresponsible he is. I hope they can bring the past 3 years into account for your stability.

I had a few days like that during my divorce. It's normal! But still hardtogo through. Do something nice for yourself, make a list of goals, get active if you don't work outalready. It will get better

I'm sorry you're going through this. I know there's not really a lot I can say to make you feel better, but you can pm me if you ever want or need to talk. Divorce sucks. I'm going through it too.

i'm sorry to be a goober. i just thought i was strong enough. i knew my friend would be ok, because he's so young and a good guy. he did have a very rare cancer that is very deadly though.
it's been three years since i've seen my soon to be ex. i should be alright with all this ***. i know what a loser he is with money, that's why i saved up so much and paid off my debt. i just never realized he has the ability to take all (ok half) of that away from me.
i thought i was ok... apparentlly not. wtf is wrong with me? why is this hitting me like this?

My experience with divorce in a community property state is that it can be panic attack inducing :-P

I was there 4 years ago, and was absolutely devastated when I found out that I had to take 1/2 of his debt even though I didn't accrue it (he went out an bought a $20k motorcycle after I talked to him about getting divorced <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-12.gif" alt="Angry"/> ), but he also didn't get any of my money either thankfully.
I ended up taking on almost $90k in debt with not a whole lot to show for it, and seriously thought I was done for, for a little bit. However, 4 years later I can say that I am okay, I have a great life, and I am very financially comfortable now :)
Soooo while you may be having panic attacks now, you will be so much better off later I am sure - just be sure to vent when you need to, it definitely helps!

That's crappy.

I think I'd start hiding money.

Then you'd be in jail. Wait, don't do that.
