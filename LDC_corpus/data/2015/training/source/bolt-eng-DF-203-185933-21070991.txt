A whole new level of insensitivity. (PR mentioned)

I just want to start by saying that my ob/gyn is awesome. I've been seeing her for ever and she is also a professional colleague since my office refers her lots of patients. Yesterday I had my "it's going to be 12 months - what's next" visit. First of all, I came in and was in the waiting room with 4 pregnant women. I got brought in first! yay!
So, my Dr. comes and and says I was brought in because she knew why I was there and didn't want me sitting with all the pregnant women. She recently added "Infertility" to her OB/GYN business card, so I kinda figured it was due to personal reasons since we got married at about the same time. She confirmed my suspicion and told me that her and her husband have been trying for about 2 years, etc. Then we went on to tell stories about all the comments patients make, and insensitive sh*t they say. She won the competition of jerky comments - she has had several patients call demanding to know if she was pregnant because THEY wanted to TTC and she WASN'T ALLOWED to be pregnant when they were! I am just so disturbed by this! How can you tell a woman with IF that she isn't allowed to get PG for selfish reasons???? WTF is wrong with people?

What?! That is nuts. That takes a lot of guts to expect someone else to put their life on hold for you. Wow.

Wow... the nerve of some people! If I were here, I would've been tempted to tell them to shove off and go somewhere else! That's crazy!
But I do think it's great that you have an ob/gyn that can relate (unfortunately) and understands the struggles.

That is horrible! I am glad you have a doctor who understands. I also see that you live in NJ? Your doctor isnt in NNJ is she (I am looking for a new one)?

Yikes! I'm glad your ob/gyn understands what you're going through, even though it stinks she's struggling as well.

I can't believe the nerve of some people. I wouldn't be able to keep my thoughts to myself if I were in her place.
It's nice that your doctor understands. I can't imagine what it's like for her to have IF issues and be in the job she is.

akcrr - not sure where in nnj you live anywhere near morris plains my dr works there and I love the whole practice. my dr is dr Kuchera (Mike, not Jim but Jim is nice too) and there's also dr Potash who is a woman if you're more comfortable with a woman. But everyone is great and the wait to get in isn't usually too long.
