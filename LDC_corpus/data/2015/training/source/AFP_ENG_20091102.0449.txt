Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic said he would attend a
procedural court hearing Tuesday on how to proceed with the trial he has been
boycotting since it started last week.
</P>
<P>
"I will ... be pleased to attend the status conference on Tuesday November 3,
2009," the Bosnian Serb wartime leader said in a letter addressed to presiding
judge O-Gon Kwon and made public by the tribunal on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we will be able to find a solution which will lead to not only an
expeditious trial, but a fair one."
</P>
<P>
Karadzic insisted, however, that he would not be present for the resumption of
the actual trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I have not had adequate time to prepare for it," he told the judge.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic has been boycotting his trial since it started last Monday to insist on
more time to prepare his defence, which he is conducting himself.
