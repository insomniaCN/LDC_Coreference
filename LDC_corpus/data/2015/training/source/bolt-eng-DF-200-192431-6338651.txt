I haven't heard of them either, are they very popular in England? <img src="http://static.tsrfiles.co.uk/images/smilies/confused.gif" alt=":confused:"/>

He says it at the end of 'Vice.' You have to be quick to catch it though. (4 more days 'till I see Razorlight!)

He uses it enough - *name-drop mode* When I sat opposite him on the train back from T in the Park, he seemed to be on it the whole journey, and seemingly ignoring his girlfriend.

Me and my old band used to always talk to Jonny Borrell after Razorlight gigs last year and we nearly got to support them. I bet he wouldn't even remember us now that they are bigger...maybe he would.
He said he liked talking to us.

Well I rang it, got voicemail - some funny singing - then it said the mailbox was full. Anyway, doesn't he say, "That was my number at the time", implying that it's not anymore?
