Russian arms trafficking suspect Viktor Bout has landed at a suburban New York City airport after being extradited in manacles from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. law enforcement official tells The Associated Press that Bout landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh late Tuesday. The official requested anonymity because of security concerns.
</P>
<P>
Bout's extradition follows a bruising diplomatic tug-of-war between the U.S. and Russia that could jeopardize cooperation on arms control, nuclear weapons curbs and the war in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Bout is a wealthy air cargo executive nicknamed the Merchant of Death by his critics. He's accused of arming failed states and insurgents across the Third World since the 1990s. He was arrested in 2008 in a sting operation led by U.S. narcotics agents.
</P>
<P>
Bout says he's a legitimate businessman. Russian diplomats had asked Thailand to release him.
