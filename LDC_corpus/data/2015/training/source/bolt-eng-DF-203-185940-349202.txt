Fund Raising Ideas?

A friend of mine in the volunteer club that we are in just had major surgery on a rare cancer. It was six hours and he seems to have a very good prognosis.
However, some of us in the volunteer club are very concerned about if his insurance is going to pay for everything. We talked about what kind of fund raisers we can do.
I was wondering what suggestions you may have of things you have done or seen that have raised funds.
Thank you in advance!

In my experience, food and cookbooks have done the best. Motorcycle rides do well, too.

raffle (for a gift basket or bottles of wine)
silent auction (with donated items)
is there any activity or hobby he is interested in that you could tie in (golf/running/swimming/music)
one friend who raised money for Team in Training asked for donations and if she got to a certain goal, she went swimming with the polar bear club on new year's day. I gave money for her NOT to do that.

Spaghetti dinners, pancake breakfasts, and silent auctions seem like they do well.

My mom hosts 2 wine tasting fundraisers a year for the National MS Society. A bunch of her wine geek friends donate really nice bottles of wine, a fancy local restaurant donates catering and a bunch of stuff is raffled off - wine, art, spa trips, fancy meals etc - and people can just donate to the NMSS if they want.

Have friends and family donate their unused items &amp; have a garage sale.

A few things to keep in mind when fund raising...1) go local 2) promote, promote, promote 3) keep it simple.
Here's a few ideas;
Garage sale - donated items from local companies, restaurants, friends and family,etc.
Silent auction
Bake sales (or cookbooks are great)
Restaurant events (see below)
Car washes - seems trivial but can raise money and use the kids. :)
Raffles for prizes/gift baskets
Selling chocolates/cupcakes/tshirts/beanies, etc.

Get creative. What kind of organization do you volunteer for? Do they have any upcoming fund raising events you can piggy back on?
Also, partnering with another organization is a good idea to open up an additional pool of donors.

I know that the Wendy's here (and several other restaurants; Chili's, California Pizza Kitchen, Applebee's) will partner with local organizations and do Community Nights from 5-8 where the organization makes 10% of all sales.

If you are a running club, do a 5K or mile walk in his honor.
All the other ideas are really good. I find it is pretty awesome if your method of fundraising ties in someway with the person who you are helping. I.e. runner-5k

DH and I have done a couple ice cream socials. "BYOB" (bring your own bowl) and $2 (or whatever) for all you can eat. We had a few flyers but it was mostly by word of mouth. Oh, and we did it at a local park that allowed it.

We have a scholarship fund for my late niece. This is what we have done:
Spaghetti Dinner
Pancake Breakfast (all items donated, including location)
Silent Auction (all items donated,)
Rummage Sale (all items donated, including location)
Ice Cream Social (Local ice cream shop donated percent of sales)
50/50 Drawings at all events
We sell bracelets that say various things related to my niece.
Some things we are considering for the future:
A casino trip (get certain amount from the cost of the bus tickets)
An all vendor party (31 gifts, premier jewelry, mary kay, home and garden etc. ) We will have everyone at the same location with tables set up. Each vendor will have a certain time frame to have the floor. Then each on will donate a percent of the sales from the event.

Good Luck to you!
