What does your screen name mean? I am woefully uncreative. it is the screen name I have had for just about everything since I was about 13.
What pets do you have? Does a fiance count? We have no pets. We don't even have a plant :-)

Hah. LOL. I couldn't think of anything for my screen name until finally "fake name" came to me in a flash of inspiration and Pseudonim was born. Et Walla.
I'll take a fiance for your final answer ;) And if you do ever decide on a pet, cats are much easier than dogs. Just sayin'

Dude, I am always so far behind with tv shows. I am only half way through season 4 of how I met your mother.
Were you ever married? How did you find this board?

What's your guilty pleasure? Hmm, either Vin Diesel fantasies or raw cookie dough. Depends on my mood.
Favorite movie? The Hunt for Red October. Shuddup, I like it :-)
Last song you listened to? I don't know, whatever was on the radio, I guess.

Pretty Little Liars is my guiltiest pleasure. It's on ABC Family, FFS.
I've never been married. I don't remember how I stumbled on to the nest, but I've spent a lot of time in the last few years on bedrest and I needed some entertainment. This board was the funniest, so you guys won me!

Eventually. I don't feel like it is fair to put a dog in my little apartment when we are not home that often.
Ditto for babies :-)

Do you want children someday? Yes, but I need to do the whole get married thing first. The older I get the more I realize I'm a bit immature for my age group, so my friends are all starting to have kids and i'm still a few years off.
Are you happy with your LLM? worth the money or not? The LLM did exactly what I needed it to do: Kept my loans in forbearance and kept my health insurance until I could get a full time job in the worst market for new lawyers since the dawn of time. I still have to revise my thesis by May, and I will, because I might as well finish, and well, it certainly can't hurt to know ERISA, I can't say that I am super excited about the topic.
Where do you want to take your next vacation? I want to take the trip to France I was scheduled to leave on four days after the fiance's accident. :-)
