An Israeli rabbi who founded a religious school for reformed criminals has been
arrested on suspicion of wounding one of his students in a gangland style drive-
by shooting, police said on Wednesday.

<P>
Local media said the 47-year-old rabbi, who has not been named, was the masked
motorcyclist who fired two rifle shots at seminary student Eliyahu Liberty, 23,
wounding him in the leg.

"He is suspected of having fired from a motorcycle at one of his students,"
Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben Ruby told AFP.

The attack took place in January but reports were banned by a court gag order
which was only lifted on Tuesday. The rabbi was arrested last month.

Media reports say the rabbi himself is a former felon who served two years in
prison for attempted murder, while Liberty reportedly has convictions for
burglary, robbery and blackmail.
