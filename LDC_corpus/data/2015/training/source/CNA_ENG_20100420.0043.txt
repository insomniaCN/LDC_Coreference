The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the Kaohsiung county government
Tuesday to fine Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) for serious pollution of soil and
underground water at its Jenwu plant in southern Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The plant in Kaohsiung County could be fined up to NT$150 million (US$4.76
million) , surpassing a NT$130 million administrative fine meted out to the
Kuanyin Industrial Park last year that is the highest of its kind ever levied in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hsien-heng, director of the EPA's Department of Water Protection, said the
exact amount of the fine will be decided after a remedial plan put forth by the
Jenwu plant is approved.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Jenwu plant has known since December 2003 that the underground
water was seriously polluted in its plant complex, but has failed to alert the
authorities and has not adopted emergency contingency measures.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 2009, when the EPA entered the plant to conduct an
investigation, that the plant installed recycling wells to stem the spread of
the pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that during the inspection, the EPA also discovered that the plant had
applied for a refund of nearly NT$40 million in the name of new investment for
anti-pollution facilities. The fund has yet to be approved.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that if the Jenwu plant is fined under the Water Pollution Control
Act, it can be fined just NT$600,000 at most, but if the regulation of "improper
gains" under the Administrative Penalty Act is cited, the fine will be much
higher.
</P>
<P>
The EPA has tentatively mapped out eight options, with fines ranging from NT$39
million to NT$150 million.
</P>
<P>
Amid calls by environmental groups that the plant's operations should be
suspended, Chen said that if the pollution spreads, the plant might be shut
down, but if the pollution does not get worse, it will be permitted to continue
operating.
</P>
<P>
Amid public concern about the safety of drinking water in the vicinity of the
plant, Kaohsiung county government environmental protection officials said that
96 percent of the people use tap water for drinking, while only a small number
use underground water, mostly for washing.
</P>
<P>
County government officials have started collecting samples from the wells
within the plant as well as wells in six villages surrounding the plant and test
information is expected to be available April 29.
