if you go around trying to beat people to a pulp for no reason you deserve to get stabbed

I wouldn't have a machete lying around in my parking attendant office, but if two big guys came in and started trying to beat me with weapons I certainly wouldn't have any qualms about using anything at hand to get rid of them.

Not a nice outcome by any means, but certainly understandable.

Good.

Karma is a bitch, purely self defense and I would have no problem stabbing him, I'd probably take pleasure knowing I was well within the law to do so.

Brought to justice for what? If the video is to be believed, the attendants clearly acted in self-defence.

I'm upset...

...that the father wasn't killed as well

I'm confused - when does he get stabbed in the chest? He is punching him and then they both run out the door at the end... or am I missing something?

Effectively signed his own death warrant

The attendants did nothing wrong, although in this country they would most likely have got 20 years in jail for murder.

I forgot what state they're in but if they have the 3 strike law, he will get life without parole.
