The victim who converted to Islam recently was allegedly whipped up to 40 times for going out for alcoholic drinks with friends.

The man awoke in the middle of the night to find that four men had broken into his bedroom.

As three men held the victim down on the bed, the fourth man is alleged to have lashed him 40 times with a cable.

Just as college students are well advised to give careful consideration to all the rules of the fraternity or sorority they might think go join.

He did, after all, make that bed......

Sharia: A law unto themselves
August 14, 2011 - Sharia courts have been accused of exploiting women by favouring men in their decisions, potentially leaving wives trapped in abusive marriages.

<quote>
After being beaten repeatedly by her husband  who had also threatened to kill her  Jameela turned to her local Sharia council in a desperate bid for a way out of her marriage. Today she discovers the verdict. Playing nervously with her hands, the young mother of three listens as the panel of judges discuss whether they should grant her a divorce. The council meets once a month at the Birmingham Central Mosque. Many of the cases relate to divorce and involve the husbands and wives entering the room separately to make their appeals.

In an airless room in the bowels of the mosque, Jameela is asked to explain why she wants a divorce. She replies that her husband spends most of his time with his second wife  Islamic law allows men to have up to four wives  but complains he is abusive whenever he returns to her home. Across the desk, Mohammed *Naseem, chair of the mosques Sharia council, sits alongside Talha *Bokhari, a white-robed imam, and Amra Bone, the only woman sitting on an Islamic court in England.

While a husband is not required to go through official channels to gain a divorce  being able to achieve this merely by uttering the word talaq  Islamic law requires that the wife must persuade the judges to grant her a dissolution. Although the judges appear sympathetic, they are concerned about the rights of the father, as Islamic law says he is still responsible for his childrens education. For the sake of the children, you must keep up the facade of cordial relations, says Naseem. The worst thing that can happen to a child is to see the father and mother quarrelling.

Jameela is one of hundreds of Muslims applying to Islamic courts every week for a ruling on family and financial issues. While these courts may be the cornerstone of many of Britains Pakistani and Bangla*deshi communities, there are growing concerns that they are creating a parallel legal system  and one that is developing completely unchecked. Michael Nazir-Ali, the former bishop of Rochester who was born in Pakistan, was accused of scaremongering after he told Londons Daily Telegraph three years ago that parts of the country were being turned into no-go areas for non-Muslims. To understand the impact of Sharia law you have to look at other countries, he says. At its heart it has basic inequalities between Muslims and non-Muslims, and between men and women.

See how annoying it is when one group seeks to impose their own, moral views on others?

Typical. You can't have a thread even a little critical of Islam without some useful idiot posting "Yeah, I suppose that's a little bad, but those Christians -- man, they're really awful!!"

Radical Islam thanks you for turning a blind eye and attempting to distract attention away from them, George, but they still want you dead.
