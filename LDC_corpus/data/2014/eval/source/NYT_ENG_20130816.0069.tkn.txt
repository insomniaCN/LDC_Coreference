Jacques Vergès , the French lawyer who embraced anti-colonial causes and the role of devil ’s advocate on a world stage to defend war criminals , terrorists , dictators and other notorious villains of the 20th century , died Thursday in Paris . He was 88 .
< / P> 
<P> 
The cause was a heart attack at around 8 p.m. as he was preparing to dine with friends , according to his publisher , Éditions Pierre - Guillaume de Roux . He died in the Parisian house where the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire once lived , the publisher said in a statement .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ The ideal place for the last theatrical act that was the death of this born actor who , like Voltaire , cultivated the art of permanent revolt and volte - face , ” the statement said , reflecting the lawyer ’s reputation for asking disturbing questions on behalf of notorious clients .
< / P> 
<P> 
Is a killer a terrorist or a patriot ? Can laws be used to judge good and evil ? For more than 50 years , Vergès raised such questions in defense of clients who claimed to be acting for political causes , although they were charged with genocide , crimes against humanity , bombings , hijackings and the murder of innocents .
< / P> 
<P> 
They included the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie ; the terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez , aka Carlos the Jackal ; and Cambodia ’s Khmer Rouge head of state , Khieu Samphan . Vergès also sought to defend former presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq , who was executed for crimes against humanity , and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia , who represented himself in a war - crimes trial but died before a verdict .
< / P> 
<P> 
Like many of his clients , Vergès , the son of a Vietnamese woman and a French diplomat , was an enigma . Assassins targeted him . There were hints of ties to secret services , to terrorists he defended and to Mao Zedong , Che Guevara and other revolutionaries . He was a confidant of Pol Pot , the tyrant blamed for the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians . He married a terrorist he saved from the guillotine , but left her and his two children and disappeared for eight years .

“ He ’s a slippery man , ” director Barbet Schroeder , who made “ Terror ’s Advocate , ” a 2007 documentary on Vergès and terrorism as a political weapon , told The New York Times in 2007 . “ You can never touch him . He loves the mystery . The reason is that there are certain things he can not talk about . He would be in deep trouble if the truth came out . ”

In a career that paralleled the postwar disintegration of colonial empires in Asia , Africa and the Middle East , Vergès rose to prominence in the late 1950s defending Algerians accused of terrorist bombings . Instead of contesting the evidence of French prosecutors in court , he insisted that the defendants were resistance fighters in a just war of liberation and challenged the legal and moral legitimacy of the trials .

<P> 
While most of his clients were convicted , the trials drew international attention to Vergès , and long after Algerian independence in 1962 his tactics served as a blueprint for his cases , which became public platforms to indict France and other Western nations for what he called crimes of racist colonialism and the exploitation of Third World peoples .

In the late 1960s , Vergès broadened his horizons , defending Palestinians charged with attacks on El Al aircraft in Athens and Zurich . He later represented members of the Red Army Faction in Germany , whose bombings he called the work of “ soldiers in a noble cause . ”

<P> 
Vergès ’ most famous case was his defense of Klaus Barbie , the wartime Gestapo leader known as “ the Butcher of Lyons ” for his role in the torture , execution and deportation to death camps of thousands of French citizens . After years in hiding , during which he is believed to have assisted Western intelligence services , Barbie was extradited from Bolivia to France in 1983 .

<P> 
At his war - crimes trial in 1987 , Barbie walked out , refusing to hear testimony of his horrors . Vergès virtually ignored the charges , and attacked Israel , France and other nations for committing “ crimes against humanity ” that he called “ more serious ” than those ascribed to Barbie . Critics said he trivialized genocide to defend a monster . Barbie was convicted and sentenced to life in prison , where he died in 1991 .

<P> 
“ I practice the ' defense de la rupture , '” Vergès told The New York Times during his work on the Barbie case , meaning a tactic of confrontation with the judicial system rather than one that works within it . “ My law is to be against all laws . My morality is to be against all morality . ”

Jacques Vergès and his twin brother , Paul , were born March 5 , 1925 , in Ubon Ratchathani , Siam , now Thailand . Their Vietnamese mother died when they were 3 and their father , Raymond Vergès , a French diplomat , raised them on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion . Paul became a founder of the Réunion Communist Party and a member of the European Parliament .

In 1942 , with his father ’s encouragement , Jacques sailed to England , joined Charles de Gaulle ’s Free French Forces and fought in the Resistance . After the war , he studied law at the University of Paris , joined the Communist Party and in 1949 became a leader of an anti-colonial student movement . His student friends included Khieu Samphan and Saloth Sar , the future Pol Pot . In the early 1950s Vergès led a Communist youth organization in Prague .

<P> 
Returning to Paris , he became a lawyer in 1955 and gained fame defending Algerian guerrilla fighters . In a notorious case , Djamila Bouhired was convicted in 1957 of killing 11 people in an Algiers bombing and sentenced to death . As she awaited the guillotine , it was revealed that she had been tortured during questioning . Vergès campaigned for a reprieve . Many world leaders , including the Soviet leader , Nikita Khrushchev , demanded her release . Her execution was postponed , and in 1962 she was released .
< / P> 
<P> 
In 1965 , Vergès and Bouhired were married . They had two children , Meriem and Liess .
< / P> 
<P> 
The couple founded a popular magazine , Révolution , in 1968 . In 1970 , Vergès disappeared . His whereabouts remained a mystery , although he was rumored to be in Cambodia with Pol Pot and in the Middle East with Palestinian groups . He reappeared in Paris in 1978 and resumed his law practice .
< / P> 
<P> 
His ties to Carlos the Jackal were murky but probably dated to 1982 , when he defended Magdalena Kopp , the terrorist ’s girlfriend and accomplice ( and later his wife ) , who was caught with explosives in Paris . Wanted for many terrorist acts in the name of Palestinian liberation in the 1970s and '80s , Carlos was captured by French agents in Sudan in 1994 and flown to Paris .
< / P> 
<P> 
Vergès called it a kidnapping and represented Carlos in the early stages of his case , but they had a falling out over tactics . The Venezuelan - born terrorist hired other lawyers , was convicted in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison . The verdict and sentence were affirmed in another trial years later .

<P> 
After Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003 , Vergès , who had been hired to defend other ousted Iraqi leaders , offered to represent him . The family of the deposed Iraqi leader chose another lawyer , and Saddam was executed in 2006 . Vergès also offered to defend Milosevic , but he chose to represent himself in a trial that began in The Hague in 2002 . Milosevic died in 2006 before the case could be concluded .

<P> 
In 2008 , as Khieu Samphan made his first appearance before Cambodia ’s genocide tribunal , Vergès , representing his old friend , created a tumultuous scene and stormed out after erupting at a panel of judges because documents for the pretrial hearing had not been translated into French .
< / P> 
<P> 
He argued that his client had held no real power as Cambodians had died of starvation , disease , forced labor and massacres during the brutal Khmer Rouge drive to create a classless society . He insisted that the power - and responsibility for the Cambodian tragedy - belonged to Pol Pot , who died in 1998 .
