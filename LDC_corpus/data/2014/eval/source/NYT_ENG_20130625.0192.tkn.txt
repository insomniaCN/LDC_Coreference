PROSECUTORS AGAIN ARGUE FOR EXECUTION OF DETECTIVES' KILLER 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
NEW YORK - The long legal ordeal of Ronell Wilson , who was convicted seven years ago of murdering two undercover police detectives but then had his death sentence vacated , began anew on Monday , as prosecutors opened a second trial with the goal of having him executed .
< / P> 
<P> 
In a packed courtroom in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn , the lead prosecutor on the case , James G . McGovern , described the moments leading up to the shootings in stark terms .
< / P> 
<P> 
On March 10 , 2003 , Wilson , a member of the Bloods gang , climbed into a car with James Nemorin and Rodney J . Andrews , detectives who had driven to Staten Island as part of a sting operation to buy illegal guns . He led the two men to a secluded neighborhood where he shot each of them in the back of the head . He dumped the bodies from the car and drove off , covered in blood .

<P> 
Over the course of the next several weeks , the jury must decide whether to sentence Wilson , 31 , whose guilt is not in question , to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole .
< / P> 
<P> 
New York state ’s highest court struck down the death penalty in 2004 , and no one other than Wilson has been sentenced to death in the state in a half - century , but federal prosecutors here can still seek to execute people convicted of federal crimes .

“ It was that night that this man , Ronell Wilson , to impress members of his gang , to raise his status , blasted hollow - point bullets into their brains , ” McGovern said , turning to point at Wilson . “ They deserved a life . Now if justice is to be done , the defendant does not . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
McGovern talked slowly , pacing in small circles in front of the jury , pausing after each sentence to let the weight of the accusations against Wilson fall hard . He displayed photographs of the detectives on large screens in the courtroom , including one of Andrews standing alongside his sons and wearing the same leather jacket he wore when he was murdered . Family members in the courtroom began to cry .

<P> 
Lawyers for Wilson face an unusual burden , proving not that their client is innocent of the crimes but that there were enough mitigating circumstances to save him from a death sentence . Richard Jasper , who made his opening statement with the help of a slide presentation entitled “ A Case for Life , ” centered this defense on portraits of a troubled childhood defined by extreme neglect .
< / P> 
<P> 
By age 6 , according to the account , Wilson had been repeatedly abandoned by his crack - addicted mother ; he was eventually placed in a psychiatric hospital , where he told a worker that he wanted to die . Wilson was hospitalized at least two more times , Jasper said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Jasper sought to put the full weight of the death sentence on the shoulders of the jurors , calling the case “ the most important decision of your entire life . ” He said Wilson should die “ on God ’s time and not man ’s time . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
The details of the case were familiar to most of the people in the courtroom . Wilson was convicted in 2006 and weeks later was sentenced to death , the first death sentence delivered in New York since 1954 . In 2010 an appellate court ruled prosecutors had denied Wilson ’s constitutional rights by inflaming the jury during closing arguments and tossed out the death sentence , while leaving the conviction in place .

<P> 
The retrial took place even though Judge Nicholas G . Garaufis had written a letter to the Justice Department questioning whether it was worth the time and expense , given that Wilson was already certain to spend the rest of his life in prison .
< / P> 
<P> 
Already the defense in the latest case , which is paid for by the government , has cost $ 1.6 million - and that does not include the cost of the prosecution or the courts in a trial that is expected to last more than a month . The retrial proved such an unusual spectacle that some viewers had to be diverted to an overflow room to watch on closed - circuit television .
< / P> 
<P> 
It comes weeks after Wilson again made headlines , this time when it was discovered that he had been involved in a sexual relationship with a prison guard , Nancy Gonzalez , and had impregnated her . Gonzalez has given birth to their son and faces criminal charges stemming from the relationship .
< / P> 
<P> 
By the end of the day on Monday , the prosecution had called three witnesses , including a former sergeant whose job it was to oversee the gun sting that night in 2003 .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ It ’s just like reliving it all over , ” Detective Mechelle King , who was a close friend of Andrews , said in an interview outside of the courtroom .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Even though it ’s 10 years , they do n’t realize that 10 years to other people and 10 years to the family is a completely different time frame . ”
