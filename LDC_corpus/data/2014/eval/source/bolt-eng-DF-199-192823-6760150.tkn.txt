Gee , stuff gets intense on occasion . And sometimes one is all by oneself on it .

Let me tell you about my dream ... 

Only half kidding , as this very morning I woke up annoyed at my own point of view on something . I was still annoyed and remembered whatever it was about ten minutes later ... rather unusual . But then it effervesced .

OK , this woman might not be so well . Sometimes I 'm sorry for the giant spotlight on everything .

OMG . The nappy plan is far more bizarre than the kidnapping .

But , seriously people . When you are 43 , you have to go the extra mile to hang on to your man .

Years ago I was in Las Vegas on business and spoke with a local at poolside . She told me that there are many nutty gamblers who have found their favourite one - armed - bandit .
They get to it early in the morning and stay in front of it all day , wearing diapers because they do n't want to lose 'THAT' machine .
