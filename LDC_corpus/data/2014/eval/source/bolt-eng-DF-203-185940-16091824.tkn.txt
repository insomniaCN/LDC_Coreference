I hate my job . I 've been there 9 years and I used to love it , but the management changed and now they are treating me very poorly . I recently was reprimanded because they say I 'm not committed enough . I 've honestly been unhappy here for the last 2 years and have considered leaving , but have n't because I have a great salary and 4 weeks vacation .
Well , I finally think I need to leave . I 'm burnt out and and thinking about quitting , taking a month off and then looking for a new job . We have enough savings to get by on one salary for over a year . The idea of taking time off is so appealing , but I 'm afraid if I ca n't find another job afterwards . The job market I this area is pretty good especially for technical people like me . I 'm also really interesting in trying something new , so I do n't plan to be picky when it comes to finding another job . Am insane to consider leaving my job without another one lined up ?

Maybe not insane , but yes , I think it would be foolish to quit your job without another one lined up .
Statistically , you 're more likely to be hired when you 're already employed . Start looking now . Then try to negotiate for a few week lead time to start at a new position , and then hand in your notice , get your vacation pay , and take a few weeks off .

Sometimes I get fed up too and want to quit . But then I remember that I have a great salary and my company takes forever to fire people , so it would make more sense for me to just work slower than to walk away . I 've never had to do this luckily . I have also been at the same place for 9 years and worry if my skills would transfer well to other companies .

I do n't think you 're insane to do that . However , I would start preparing for a new job before you quit . Doing things like searching for a job , updating your resume , etc. might put you in a better mood & amp ; make your job seem more manageable in the meantime , so it might help get you through if you want to keep working until you find a new job .
You can always negotiate a start date that 's a few weeks out to still get your time off .

Find another job FIRST - and negotiate a start date a month out . That gives you some time off and a job .

Do n't do it . Find a new job first ? You should be able to take some time off between jobs . I took a month off the last time I changed jobs . I highly recommend it if you can do it .

Easier to find a job when you have a job . I understand where you stand , I myself am pretty much done with my current position , but have been holding out since I wo n't just quite without something lined up . Contact head hunters , etc. I been looking for 2 years , its not as easy as it seems , still not a lot of jobs out there that are full time with benefits .

My gosh , NO , you are not insane to want to quit . You are insane to stay in a job that fills you with so much constant stress and dissatisfaction .
IMO , this job ended a long time ago and you should have vacated before your status fell to the place it is now . If this job was your boyfriend , you would have broken up with him by now for being such an inconsiderate , controlling jerk , and all your friends would be patting you on the back for finally dumping him .
You are a smart , talented , valuable person and you should not stay in ANY circumstance that makes you doubt that , or regret being there .
Take your vacation and start getting excited about how much better the future will be . Believe in yourself and get the hell out of there .
