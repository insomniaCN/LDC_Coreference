Growing up , it was customary to park a kid in front of the tv every night at 6 pm to watch Walter Chronkite . Through the medium of television news , I watched the Birmingham March and other events of the civil rights movement almost as they happened , and Dr. King was mythical to me . I was as inconsolable when he died as I would have been if I had lost a loved one . In my mind , I DID lose a loved one .

After King 's assasination in 1968 ( when I was 8 years old and in the 4th grade ) , few leaders of the Civil Rights Movement really appealed to me as he had . I adored Malcolm X by the time I reached high school , but I did n't associate him with mainstream civil rights folks . Same with Angela Davis , Huey Newton and Bobby Seale , who I came to admire while in college ... exciting , engaging young people but not really the rightful heirs to MLK 's position .

Jessie Jackson and Al Sharpton lacked MLK 's dignity , among other qualities . Only one man ever even began to fill the void , and that was Rev. Benjamin Hooks , leader of the NAACP from 1977 till 1992 . With his intelligence and quiet dignity , he managed to restore the organization to some / most of its former glory . To me , Rev. Hooks was not a historical figure ... he was as present in my life during turbulent times as your heros may be to you today .

Rev. Hooks died last week , at 85 . Doubtless a peaceful death and certainly after a life of extraordinary accomplishments . It 's just hard to watch , one by one , as the heros of my youth die off . I feel a real sense of grief , and of gratitude .

Dorothy Height I was not as aware of growing up , but she was a Giant of the civil rights movement . She passed away last week as well , at the age of 98 . Born in 1912 , Ms. Height was said to have seen more of the civil rights movement than any other leader , and for most of her era , women in leadership positions were not common . She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and Congressional Gold Medal for her work towards both racial and gender equality .

President Obama called her " the Godmother of the Civil Rights Movement " .

I wish I had known more about her during her life , but I acknowledge the debt I owe her ... and that every American woman owes her . Every American , period .

RIP , Rev. Hooks and Ms. Height .

Thank you for everything , especially the lessons in dignity in the face of oppression and injustice .

I greatly appreciate both of you commenting . There are days I feel as if most of my life experience is as relevant as the bronze saw . But these were real people in my life , and their passing pains me .
