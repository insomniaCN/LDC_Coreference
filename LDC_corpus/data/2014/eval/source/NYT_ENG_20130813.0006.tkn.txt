The Justice Department , along with the attorneys general of six states and the District of Columbia , filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block the proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways .
< / P> 
<P> 
Dealing an unexpected blow to a yearlong effort to create the world ’s biggest airline , the Justice Department said the merger between the two airlines would substantially reduce competition , increase airfares and cut service .

After approving a series of mergers between the nation ’s airlines in recent years , the Justice Department ’s decision came as a surprise to both carriers , who had expressed confidence the deal would go through with only a few changes . Antitrust regulators had not challenged an airline merger since the planned tie - up between United Airlines and US Airways in 2001 .
< / P> 
<P> 
Since then , Delta Air Lines merged with Northwest Airlines , United merged with Continental , and Southwest merged with AirTran .
< / P> 
<P> 
In recent years , however , consumer groups and some economists have warned that the wave of consolidation in the airline sector had contributed to higher airfares and less choice for consumers .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Today ’s action proves our determination to fight for the best interests of consumers by ensuring robust competition in the marketplace , ” said Eric H . Holder Jr . , the U.S. attorney general .
< / P> 
<P> 
The civil antitrust lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the planned deal .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Justice Department said the vast majority of domestic airline routes were already highly concentrated . A merger of American and US Airways , it said , would result in four airlines controlling more than 80 percent of the U.S. market for commercial air travel .
< / P> 
<P> 
It also found that the planned merger would have created a dominant carrier at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington , where it would control 69 percent of the takeoff and landing slots and have a monopoly on 63 percent of the nonstop routes served from there .
< / P> 
<P> 
The two airlines said they would defend their merger plan . “ We believe that the DOJ is wrong in its assessment of our merger . Integrating the complementary networks of American and US Airways to benefit passengers is the motivation for bringing these airlines together , ” they said in a statement . “ Blocking this pro-competitive merger will deny customers access to a broader airline network that gives them more choices . ”

<P> 
The participating attorneys general are from Texas and Arizona , where American and US Airways are based , as well as Florida , the District of Columbia , Pennsylvania , Tennessee and Virginia .
