I know I may be stepping into a minefield here but I have to ask this . I was listening to NPR on the way to work today and one of their reporters was at a celebration that Huckabee held after winning in Iowa . The reporter was clearly next to a female who was praying in a loud , almost ranting type of way , asking God to lift up Mike Huckabee , etc etc and asking God to make sure that Huckabee is proud of being a pastor and how we are to select leaders who are spiritual , etc. I would have given anything to see a videotape of it 

The press can do a remarkable job of taking even the most innocuous instance and sometimes just by broadcasting it , make it look really bad . This was one of those cases .

I asked some fellow Christians about a thesis that was forming in my mind about the possibility of Huckabee being elected . I specifically asked if we , as Christians , have become so pious that we believe that the only person who can lead this country is an ordained Baptist minister . I mean , think about that for a second . The field is wide open , yet why is it that the Christians pile on Mike Huckabee 's wagon and openly snub other people , like Mitt Romney ? It would be wrong of us to issue a call to Mitt Romney to be the pastor of First Baptist church . Clearly he does not share our doctrine . But does that mean that we should n't support him ? Or what about Giuliani ? He has been married and divorced several times . But I would remind folks that the divorce rate is the same for those of us who are " churched " and those who are unchurched . Yet it seems like we judge him on his divorces . Does anybody really believe that if Giuliani gets elected that his wife is going to divorce the powerful person in the country while he is in office ? Not a chance . Giuliani 's marriage is not going to end in divorce ( hopefully ever ) but especially not if he gets elected . Bottom line ? There is no way that a if a republican gets elected that they will go act in a manner contrary to conservative opinions on abortion , gay marriage , etc. And by the way , there are bigger issues than those . To do so would be the death knell of the republicans .

I 'm not saying that I endorse any of these candidates . But I do believe that we should n't jump on Huckabee 's wagon just because he is a pastor .

So if what I said is true about what a republican president will not do , then why the support for Huckabee ? Are some of us naive ? Am I the only one who feels that he is using Jesus as a prop in the election ( think of his Christmas day ad if you disagree ) .

I would sooner walk across hot coals than attend a Huckabee rally and rant and cheer when he speaks of values . Same thing goes for most rallies by most of today 's presidential candidates . They are using us as props and we need to be resistant of that . To put it another way , if you had attended a rally for George W Bush back in 2000 , would you dare tell anyone now that you were there back then ? Probably not .

And for the young lady who was probably miked for her prayer , I would respectfully ask that she keep it down . Showboating like that , I believe , only pushes us backward in our ability to spread the Gospel and bring more people to Christ .

My question is why are people jumping on Huckabee 's bandwagon . The rest of it was food for thought . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/thumbsup.gif"/>

Maybe they found someone they can identify with that is in the race that is n't a slick New England republican - poser politician or a beltway insider or a fringe nutjob ...

Maybe you are right . My concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from Christian evangelicals . He does not have the broad support that Obama has . With Huck , it is very concentrated .

More politicians than not are like that . But they are going for him without so much as a glance at his record . Look at all the people he paroled while in Arkansas . I heard it was half the state . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/> Okay , I 'm kidding . The guy does n't have that great of a record . Just because he shares our beliefs does n't entitle him to the presidency . Separation of church and state exists for a reason and do n't think for a second that if he gets in that the lines wo n't become dangerously blurred .
