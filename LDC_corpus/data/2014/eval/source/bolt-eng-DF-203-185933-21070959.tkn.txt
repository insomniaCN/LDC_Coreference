Dobby is in goal tonight !! I 'm sure you 're the only one that will appreciate this , and it makes me so happy to see him . The only thing that would have made me happier is if Hutchy was in goal <img src= " http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-1.gif" alt= " Smile " / > 

Now let 's see if he can pull out a win !!

I am really excited to see him play ! A W tonight will be a great thing for us going in to the playoffs , although , I am excited that Julien is resting a few people who need the rest .

He 's played well in Providence all season ( well except when he was out with injury ) 
I 'm glad Bergy and Chara are getting the rest they can us it . I just want to get to the playoffs and another cup would be fabulous !!

Shhhh ! We do n't say the C word in that sense ! Haha ! I have been following him in Providence , and I really like him . I like him better than Tuukka , but I am not a Tuukka fan as a person . Before he was injured he was more reliable in net though .

I forgot I wo n't mention the " C " word <img src= " http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-2.gif" alt= " Big Smile " / > 
Tuukka was playing well before the injury and I love him so much I met him a bunch of times when he was in Providence and he was always so sweet , I 'm guessing being on the big team gave him a big ego ? That makes me sad to hear , but I know a lot of guys get like that and it 's just sad .
Funny story one of the games Providence was playing in Hartford we sat and talked to Dobby during the game . We had seats next to the tunnel where the put the goalie ( since they do n't have room for him on the bench ) and we were watching the game and talking to him he 's so sweet .

I do n't like him because he was mean to my cousin when my cousin was playing in Providence . He also has n't been great to a lot of the kids who wait outside after the games . I think he has gotten a big ego in Boston . Which stinks . I like going down to the Providence games ! Do you go a lot ? 
BTW , have you seen Bear and the Gang ? If not , get the Bruins app ( If you have a smart phone ! ) It is amazing !

I really hate when that happens to players , especially my favorite ones .
We have season tickets in Providence ( well 1 / 2 season ) we split the season between Providence and Bridgeport , but we 're going to the last game of the season on the 15th and I ca n't wait .
I have seen Bear and the Gang it 's very cute . The 1st episode was funny , I loved Brad and the Bear playing NHL12 and Jack is calling the game that really made me laugh .
I love the Bear !! He got me through the playoffs , I posted the Victory Dance video on FB every time they won a series .
