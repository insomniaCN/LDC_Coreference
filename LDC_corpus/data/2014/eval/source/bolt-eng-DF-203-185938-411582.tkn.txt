How could anyone on the ship 's bridge not realize they were only 600 ft from land with or without radar ? ??? ? !!! 
We just came home from a cruise on Carnival and when we were in Roatan ( Honduras ) the captain on a Costa Ship ( Atlantica ) took 2 hours to moor up at the pier ... which made us have to wait to moor up too ( takes about 15 mins normally ) . Our captain sent over a message to say he would tender over and moor up for him but the request was denied . Anyway , makes me wonder about the competency of the Costa captains .

She said an Argentine couple handed her their three - year - old daughter , as they were unable to keep their balance . ‘ I grabbed the baby . But then I was being pushed down , ’ she said . ‘ I did n’t want the baby to fall down the stairs . I gave the baby back . I could n’t hold her . I thought that was the end and I thought they should be with their baby . I wonder where they are . ’

That statement made me sick . I did n't want the baby to fall down the stairs , instead I 'd rather she drown with her parents .
Awesome .

Someone is both thoughtless and * really * picky about analogies . " It was n't the exact same ship that sank in the same water , soooo "

I read it as " fall down the stairs to her death with us , or stay with the parents and they drown together " Like they did n't have a choice - either way was death - either with strangers or with her parents .
Horrific . Absolutely horrific .
I simply can not imagine and hope to never face something similar .
