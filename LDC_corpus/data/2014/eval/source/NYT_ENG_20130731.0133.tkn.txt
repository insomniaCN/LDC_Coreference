< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
Juan David Ochoa Vásquez , a founder of the violent and powerful Medellín cartel in Colombia , which ruled the international cocaine trade in the 1980s , died on Thursday in a medical clinic in Medellín . He was 65 .
< / P> 
<P> 
The cause was a heart attack , The Associated Press in Bogotá reported .
< / P> 
<P> 
Ochoa was one of three brothers who raised horses and ran restaurants before their family built a brutal , billion - dollar business smuggling drugs to the United States and other countries .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Ochoas - Juan David was the oldest , followed by Jorge Luis and Fabio - were perhaps less infamous than some of their partners .
< / P> 
<P> 
Another co-founder of the cartel , Pablo Escobar , was linked to hundreds of murders before he was killed by the police in 1993 . Another partner , Carlos Lehder Rivas , who smuggled drugs from a private island in the Bahamas before joining the Medellín , was convicted of drug trafficking and is serving a life sentence in federal prison in the United States .
< / P> 
<P> 
In the early 1990s , all three Ochoa brothers surrendered and pleaded guilty to certain crimes under an agreement with the Colombian government that included limited sentences to be served in Colombia . The brothers served about five years in prison , where they lived together , sewed saddles and ate their mother ’s cooking - in part because she was worried that another cook might try to poison them .
< / P> 
<P> 
Juan David was the last of his brothers to agree to the plea deal , which was offered at a time when the Colombian government was increasing pressure on drug lords , including Escobar .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ My mother , my sisters kept saying , 'Get out of this - save yourself , '” he told The New York Times in an interview from prison in 1995 .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Ochoas had all been released by 1996 , but Fabio later returned to prison after being charged with new crimes in the late 1990s . He was eventually extradited to the United States , and in 2003 was convicted of two counts of drug conspiracy . He is serving a 30 - year sentence .
< / P> 
<P> 
The family fought Fabio ’s extradition with an aggressive but unsuccessful legal and public relations campaign . Juan David and Jorge Luis avoided extradition , but other governments found at least some ways to punish them .
< / P> 
<P> 
In 1987 , federal authorities in the United States seized a ranch and 39 Paso Fino walking horses that Juan David owned in Central Florida . Later , after his release from prison , he returned to raising horses and , he said , respectability .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Everyone loves us ; the doors open for us all over , ” Juan David Ochoa said in an interview with The Times on the day his brother was extradited . “ Unfortunately , in a bad time and bad hour , when we were younger , we got into that business . ”
