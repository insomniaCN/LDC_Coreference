With some states now dealing with the issue of stopping illegal immigration , where does federal jurisdiction stop and state jurisdiction begin ? Is this one of those issues that SCOTUS will decide for us again ?

I may be wrong but only if two states disagree with where the borders are . As for that with Mexico , only if Mexican troops get involved would the state have to defer to the federal jurisdiction .

From what I understand they still do . Beside the point .

This will be a matter of big $ $ $ $ $ .
My guess is that 's why it has n't happened yet , by a state going it alone .

Offer community service credit for people to sit there and be minutemen . That would halt the crossings pretty thoroughly .
