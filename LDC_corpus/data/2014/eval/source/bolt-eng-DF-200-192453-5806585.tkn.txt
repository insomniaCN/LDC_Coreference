I do n't know how the rest of you feel but I 'm sick of seeing Prejudice / Racist / Lowerclass / Upperclass threads .

Whether they do right or wrong people are people at the end of the day regardless of their skin colour , faith , the area they grew up in or where their parents are from .

I 'm not racist or prejudice and try not to be judgemental . I 'm proud of my upbringing and my heritage . I 've got open accepting parents who ensured we could see people for who they are , good or bad regardless of other factors .

People are people X

Obviously I agree with judging people as inderviduals regardless of class , race ... I mean , everyone does ! 

But with things like the riots in London , it is naiive to believe that inderviduals are doing it for the fun of it , and take things at face - value . We need to understand the causes behind violence if we are to face them and help move the country forward .

This is the thing though , not everybody does .

I totally agree with you on this and with all the police cuts things may become harder to manage ( but that 's another subject haha ) 

But my point is that on a site like this it 's a shame to see so many people that seem to take a dislike to people because of the simplest of things .

Please stop making excuses for these behaviours by playing the race card .
It is a fact that blacks have done this to a much wider extent than whites thus far , in instigating and leading it , even if white chavs ( by sheer numbers ) are starting to join in at a tiny rate too .

There are loads and loads of poor East Asians , Indians and poor East Europeans who had * nothing * and did n't even know the language and did much better . Blacks in Britain are overwhelmingly born here , they know the culture and have free health care , education etc etc. 

There are no excuses whatsoever . What has happened is disgraceful and what 's more : it is alarming . Is this what will happen in a time of crisis , people will ask , instead of uniting the multicultural dream will become a looting , rioting and violent nightmare .

This thread has NOTHING to do with the riots ! Look at when I put it up and it was in reference to other threads / posts on here .

But as you 're on it ..... 

" Blacks " alone are not to blame . People are people ! It just so happened that where is started , there are a lot of black people . Its relative to the area . Ie , Asian people in B'ham , caucasian in Manchester etc etc. 

I have black family in London who are peaceful , work hard and play a big part in their community . I have some White family in other areas who are layabouts , in and out of prison and are out for benefits they can get : - / /
