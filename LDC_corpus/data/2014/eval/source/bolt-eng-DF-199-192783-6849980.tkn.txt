Protesters rally against Iraq war 

Posted : Sunday , February 16 , 9:18 am EST 

Thousands of antiwar demonstrators packed more than 20 blocks near the United Nations headquarters Saturday , the largest of an estimated 150 peace rallies across the nation that filled city streets with banners , chanting and people from all walks of life .
Protests were held across the nation , from Maine to Hawaii , and from Texas to Minnesota .

Organizers of the New York rally , who had hoped for 100,000 people , estimated the crowd at anywhere from 375,000 to 500,000 . NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly said about 100,000 people were in the crowd , which stretched 20 blocks deep and spanned three avenues .

Protests that started Friday in Australia continued through the weekend with a massive Sunday demonstration of more than 100,000 people in Sydney . The protests were the biggest in Australia since the Vietnam War three decades ago .

In a global outpouring of anti-war sentiment , Rome claimed the biggest turnout - 1 million according to police , while organizers claimed three times that figure .

In London , at least 750,000 people demonstrated in what police called the city 's largest demonstration ever . In Spain , several million people turned out at antiwar rallies in about 55 cities and towns across the country , with more than 500,000 each attending rallies in Madrid and Barcelona .

Do you think the worldwide protests against the policies of the US government and more specifically Bush and company will have an impact upon our anticipated action in Iraq . Or will Bush continue to see evil , hear evil and do evil .

No , i 'm afraid ! 

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told both " Fox News Sunday " and NBC 's " Meet the Press " that President Bush would not back down , despite pleas last week from most members of the U.N. Security Council that he give weapons inspectors more time .

" The coalition of the willing is preparing , " she told Fox . " We are in a period now , a diplomatic window , in which we should be discussing how the Security Council can best carry out its obligations . She said Washington will not accept " delaying tactics " at the United Nations Security Council .

They sent Condi Rice out on Sunday , and by what she said and how she said it , they'yre taking note , all right . One of the biggest problems is that the Bush league is left with nowhere to go . If they go in , the can flatten Iraq , but that would not be a victory . If they go in , they are hoping they will be seen in a different light - but increaasingly there is a public view of a bully , of the same attitude that characterized Bush two years ago . If they back off , they lose tremendous face . Not a sign of a great power that does n't allow itself to move its position . Thie time there were peace marches all over the world , numbering in the millions , with full newspaper coverage . pretty hard to ignore .

Hmmm - ' tia an interesting question . Generally I think no. However , when they become as big as the ones over the last couple of days , or when they go on and on ( like the mothers in Argentina ) I think they do have an effect on governments . Tony Blair DID look very weighed down by the hugeness - especially given they know what a huge number of people who feel the same stay home .

My Prime Minister , while insisting that Oz commitment stays the same - ( though he continues to fudge on whether troops will be committed sans UN sanction ) certainly looked very troubled - I suspect he is genuinely horrified at the thought of war , and is being hammered by opinion polls , the Opposition and his own party , many of whom have expressed opposition .

This one is very different from our sending troops to East Timor - where the people were insisting it happen way ahead of government resolve , or the commitment to Afghanistan , which had strong popular support .

Also , the rallies in Oz brought out people who would never normally protest - this could mean votes at the next election ... 

But - who knows .

Why were people banned from assembling in NYC ?

They were n't banne from assembling , but from marching . Among reasons - necessity for more police , fire engines , EMS trucks ( all required to be there - and there are severe money problems right now , and this would be oveertime ) ; a desire to keep problem spots away from the U.N. ( nobody ever knows what will happen with a crowd ) ; traffic . Marches block off streets and can create severe blockage problems . Probably , also , because there was a march last month . Also , the crime rate is rising , and a march takes police away and gives more opportunities .

I do n't know any of this , I 'm guessing , but I really do n't think NYC is all to blame . And they did give a terrific assembly spot .

The Bloomberg administration made the decision well before last week 's heightened security alert . A federal three - judge panel affirmed it - even though The New York Times reported a police commander told a federal judge that he had no reason to expect violence .

The Homeland Security Department alerted the country that there 's a possible threat , but urged Americans to go on with our lives . Anyone considering marching with 100,000 other people can decide for themselves whether to take the risk .

But there 's more to it than that . The Bush administration - which is in the midst of trying to sell the war to the public - filed a brief urging the judges to uphold denial of the permit . And the Bloomberg administration has no intention of forcing a St. Patrick 's Day standstill instead of a parade - even though it 's bigger and likely more raucous .

" The court bought , hook , line and sinker , the undifferentiated - fear factor , " said Donna Lieberman , executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union , which argued marches are a vital form of free speech .

South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu , a speaker at the rally said , " I really can not believe that a major city in the leading democracy in the world can refuse people this particular right . " 

Indeed .

The Bush administration filed a brief in support of a city government 's attempts to suppress a march which was protesting their policies .

Let 's all understand something , citizens .

We are under threat from terrorists .

The government has n't got enough money to defend our cities because it needs to cut taxes for the rich people , who are the most productive members of our society . Therefore , it is not in the national interest to allow people to gather in these threatened cities and drain the few precious resources we have left .

If you ca n't shut your mouths , the government will have no choice but to take some duct tape and wrap it around your heads . We 're at Code Orange , for God 's sake . It 's for your own good .

Asherman - would there EVER be a war America wished to wage that you would not support ? 

This is a serious question .

I find your stance on Vietnam , for instance , highly interesting - my understanding was that even the American administrations at the time of the war now thought it wa swrong - even McNamara , yet you support it .

What is all the fuss about being able to march ? The demonstration had the same effect march or no march and without the usual disruption caused by marches . As a native New Yorker I would prefer that marches and demonstrations be held in someone else 's city . Where they can bear the brunt of the disruption and the related costs .

Walter , 

I 'm not sure what you are alluding to .

Large , even massive demonstrations have occurred and been widely reported . One can hardly avoid the exhaltation felt by many who earnestly believe that their public opposition to military action taken against Iraq will save the world .

The spread of civil rights throughout the world is largely due to the existence and power of the United States . It is good to see that success demonstrated in the streets , even when those demonstrations are directed against our efforts to provide a stable , secure and peaceful world . Such anti-government demonstrations would not be permitted in Iraq , North Korea , China , Iran , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia and on and on and on . It is distressing that those now free are so willing to leave others in chains , and are unwilling to support those governments most responsible for their own freedom . It is gratifying that the newly freed nations of Eastern Europe recognize the dangers posed by Iraq more clearly than France . West Germany became strong behind the American shield , and now seems willing to trade it 's strength for the Socialist promise that made East Germany a wasteland . Of course , I recognize that 's an over simplification , but less far fetched than many of the accusations hurtled against the elected leaders of American , Britain and Australia .

I just wanted to say that these demonstrations were n't only applauded in the mentioned places but especially by more than 7 millions demonstrators and some more sympathisants all over in the world .

This is n't " With us or against us " . People marching against a war in Iraq are no fans of the Saddam or Kim regime .

I know Bush likes to say " Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists " Like there is no alternative . We all know Bush likes to keep things simple but you ca nt understand this complex world in such a simple black - white dichotomy .

Bunny , 

I believe the War of 1812 was a terrible mistake , and should never have been fought . The war with Mexico in 1846 probably could have been avoided , though Mexico must share much of the blame for it . Mexico was well compensated for territorial concessions , though the United States could have paid nothing at all . I think that the United States behaved shamefully in its dealings with the Indian tribes as it expanded westward . During the latter part of the 19th century , American troops were used to advance the interests of business in Latin America . I think that was wrong . The United States was propelled into the Spanish - American War by the Yellow Press , and in retrospect was not justified . Teddy 's seizure of the Philippine Islands was wrong , though I think in the long run the Philippine people benefited from their association with the United States . It follows that I 'm not a fan of the Army 's operations against the Philippine Insurrection . General Pershing 's pursuit of Pancho Villa through northern Mexico could have probably been handled better . I 'd say that there are a lot of American wars that I would have opposed in the past , and that I would oppose similar wars in the future .

I publicly opposed the war in Vietnam as early as 1962 . Only later was I convinced that our involvement was necessary and justified . As I came to see the larger picture it became evident to me that Vietnam was merely a campaign in a larger and far more serious a war . The struggle for world domination between two ideological groups extended from at least 1948 , until 1992 was in fact the Third World War . The Cold War was not fought by large uniformed armies of clearly delineated powers , but rather was a slow , simmering struggle for control of areas on the edge . Communist aggression in Korea and Vietnam had to be resisted . Not to resist would have caused unaligned countries would have shift their allegiance to the Communists , the side appearing most likely to prevail in the end . When the United States did leave Vietnam , that 's exactly what happened . Many third world nations became clients of the USSR , and " National Liberation " movements armed and supported by Russia and China increased dramatically around the world . America after Vietnam was almost paralyzed , avoided any foreign military involvement , and was increasingly unwilling to support its clients around the world . Russia , China , and Vietnam rapidly expanded and were emboldened to undertake military adventures . I still believe the Vietnam campaign was mismanaged , and remains largely misunderstood - even by people who should know better .

Simple because at the moment we are holding the gun . People are not adverse to seeing Iraq controlled and corralled . They feel that is being done by the present inspection regime and no fly zones . I should note that Saddam short of abdicating has been acquiescing in the UN demands . Reluctantly but nevertheless he has given in whenever pushed . conversely Bush has been operating on a straight line to war . There seems to be no one or nothing to deter him . It has become a crusade to rid the world of evil . The question is shall we fight evil with greater evil ?

Walter , 

BTW , I also applaud the demonstrations as an expression of a system strong enough that it is n't threatened by free speech .

You 're quite right , demonstrations were not invented by the United States . Roman citizens caused quite a stir when the bread ships from North Africa were delayed and the Gadiatorial games had to be postponed . Religious demonstrations were common during the Reformation , and often led to bloodshed . British bullets at demonstration on the Boston Commons , and at Lexington started one of the longest and most difficult wars ever involving Americans . Large peace rallies all over Europe and America were common before WWI and WWII . German demonstrations between Communist and Nazi factions were common between the wars and helped elect Herr Hitler . No , demonstrations were not invented in America .

On the other hand dictatorships of all stripes forbid any demonstration against their interests , and kill folks who demonstrate anyway . There are demonstrations in Pyong - Yang , they are nice orderly affairs where everyone is in step , properly uniformed and waving neatly lettered signs . An sanctioned demonstration in Peking brought us a picture of a lone man standing before a line of tanks -- he was later reported shot . Baghdad has lately been the scene of demonstrations expressing the same sentiments as those seen across Europe and America . Those Iraqi demonstrators , do you think they could have demonstrated demanding that Saddam honor his promises and comply finally after 12 years with UN demands that he divest himself of certain aggressive weapons ? 

Frolic , 

It is n't necessary for the demonstrators to like Saddam , or support his nefarious policies for them to serve his purposes . If everyone in every demonstration regarded Saddam as evil incarnate and wished him dead , it would not matter in the least to him so long as he achieves his end -- survival and the glory of being able to claim a victory over those who are dedicated to ridding the world of him .

Here 's the thing , I think that outside the US and the UK the protests ARE being heard .

The problem is what now ! How many of those who protested are going to send messages to the UN urging them to let inspections to continue , how many of them will send messages to the legislators urging them to pass legislation in their countries in support of inspections ? 

Actually -- this has bugged me since the Seattle protests , no attempts to build this into a POLITICAL movement .

Even if the total number of protesters in London was 5 million , this would constitute only less than 10 percent of the overall UK population . In the USA , the corresponding number would exceed 25 million people . Dissent of 10 percent is quite normal , it does not endanger stability of any administration / government , and the protesters ' numbers were much lower . Government may conclude that majority supports its policies or keeps neutrality tacitly . Despite this ( and it is especially true for Europe ) there are not few " professional protesters " that travel from capital to capital and take part in events ; these are often being counted two and more times . But , in fact , they are the same ones .

Well , Bush has said that only he , as the leader , can determine what is best for the security of the nation . He also mentioned it being good that there was a democracy .

As long as Rove , Bush , Rumsfeld and the rest can sit heavily upon the press , half of America could take to the streets , and they would be ignored by the WH . This is beginning to look like the French Revolution where the peasants were ignored , until the time came when it was the empire that was trundled off .

There does seem to be some kind of people 's revolution going on , although the royal we at te top tries to ignore it . But a noticeable thing is that its numbers are growing . Add this to the fact that for a year Bush has been trying to make Americans ( and others ) enthusiastic about his plans for Iraq , and instead of gaining fans , more and more are dropping away .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 

A PRESS RELEASE PROVIDED AS A PUBLIC SERVICE BY THE WHITE HOUSE 

While this nation 's pansy assed , love bead wearing liberal media delighted in reporting this weekend 's sad spectacle of millions of hippie communists loitering on streets throughout the world to show their support for America - hating terrorists , there is another , more important story that was not reported to the American people . To rectify this intentional oversight , the White House Press office has prepared this " information release " to give heart to all those who love President Bush enough to go along with killing any man , woman and little baby for whom he has a smart - bomb surprise up his sleeve .

Over the weekend , throngs in numbers approaching almost 80 people worldwide took to the streets to provide a poignant counterpoint to the fringe - position presented by over 6,000,000 anti-war protesters . Enjoying a courteous distance from one another that was eschewed by the dense crowd of America - hating cowards that filled the streets , sometimes almost a baker 's dozen of counter-protesters gathered on street corners and otherwise desolate gas stations in some of America 's larger medium - size towns and villages . They came to taunt the Saddam - loving anti-war vermin with placards that tended to dispense with all the geo - political mumbo - jumbo and cut to the heart of the matter by lobbing personal attacks on the traitors who are rude enough to disagree with our blameless President .
