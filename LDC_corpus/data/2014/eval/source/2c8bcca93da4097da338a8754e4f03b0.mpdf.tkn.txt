Béla Biszku ( age 92 ) , the former Hungarian Interior Minister during communism , has been convicted of war crimes . A court in Hungary has sentenced him to five and a half years in prison . The once - eminent pro-Soviet functionary is responsible , according to the indictment , for the death of dozens of Hungarians shot dead during the anti-Communist and anti-Soviet uprising in 1956 . Biszku was found guilty today of other crimes , including denying the crimes committed during the communist regime .

Biszku is alleged to have been a member of a commission that ordered the killing of civilians during the protests of 1956 . His trial began in mid-March and has attracted a great deal of attention in the Hungarian media .

Several thousand people died during the anti-Communist uprising in Hungary in 1956 .

The revolt was drowned in blood by a Soviet Army military intervention . During the subsequent purges more than 200 people were executed , 22 000 ended up in prison , and 210 00 emigrated .
