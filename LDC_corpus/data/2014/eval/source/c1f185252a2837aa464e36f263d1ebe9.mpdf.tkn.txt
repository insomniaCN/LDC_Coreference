<img src= " http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2008/09/20/bc-080919-marc-emery.jpg"/> Marc Emery is facing extradition on three drug charges for selling marijuana seeds by mail order to customers in the U.S. ( CBC ) 

Marijuana activist Marc Emery says he plans to drop his fight against extradition to the U.S. and plead guilty to one charge of drug distribution in a Seattle courtroom next month .

Emery 's extradition hearing in Vancouver was adjourned on Wednesday so his lawyer could negotiate a deal with the U.S. district attorney in which Emery could spend up to eight years in jail for one charge , while two other more serious charges are dropped , he said .

" I will be making a guilty plea to one count of marijuana distribution this summer , and then when I 'm sentenced the U.S. district attorney is going to be asking for five to eight years in a federal U.S. penitentiary , " he told CBC News on Wednesday .

After the guilty plea , Emery expects he will be sentenced in August or September and is hoping he will eventually be transferred to a Canadian jail .
Joint U.S. - Canada bust 

This is not the first time the marijuana activist has said his lawyers are cutting a deal with U.S. prosecutors . In July 2008 , Emery said he had made a deal in which he would serve a minimum of five years in jail , but he later blamed Canadian authorities when the deal fell through .

The marijuana activist is facing drug charges for selling pot seeds to U.S. customers , after his Vancouver - based mail order business was busted in a joint operation involving both U.S. and Canadian law enforcement agencies in 2005 .

He 's been fighting extradition ever since , but on Wednesday he said he now realizes it 's a fight he 's not going to win .

" Ultimately my lawyer is convinced that the Canadian government has never refused an extradition request from the United States and it 's not going to start now , " he said .

" Sometimes you have to face up to the reality of what 's going to happen , and under this scenario I may be free out of prison in two or three or four years , " he said .

Without the deal , Emery said , he would be facing much more time in jail .
" This is a preferential arrangement to the not - so - good - arrangement that would see me spend 10 , 20 , 30 years in a U.S. federal penitentiary , foreseeably the rest of my life , and that does n't give a person a lot of hope , " he said .
Prepared to do time 

" The DA wants to paint me as a large player providing a lot of marijuana to people , and we 'll bring up that it was only seeds and it was totally transparent . It was done in Canada out in the open for 10 or 12 years , " he told CBC News during an interview at the busy downtown Vancouver hemp store he still operates .

" I did n't keep any of the money Â— $ 4 million . I gave it all away to activist groups around the world , so my motives are unusual , so that does mitigate in sentencing , " said Emery , who frequently ran in provincial and federal elections as the leader of the Marijuana Party .

But the man who once spent more than two months in a Canadian prison for passing a joint to an undercover officer is now preparing for a much longer stay in a U.S. prison .

" You 've got to keep busy in jail . You 've got to be reading , in my case writing . I 'll be learning Spanish , French . You 've got to have projects , " he said .

* sigh * 

That 's what happens when you have Stephen Harper in Parliament . Stupid Conservative Government .

It 's disgusting that instead of dealing with Mr. Emery like a responsible government should - we pass him off like a hot potato to the USA for them to deal with , and to be prosecuted under their laws where he has no bargaining power and fewer rights .
