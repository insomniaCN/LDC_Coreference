BERLIN  German prosecutors said Thursday that they have filed murder charges against a 21 - year - old Kosovo Albanian in the slaying of two U.S. airmen outside Frankfurt 's airport and alleged he was inspired by online jihadist videos to kill Americans .

Arid Uka , who grew up in Germany , was charged July 4 with two counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder in connection with the March 2 attack . If convicted , he faces a possible life sentence .

Authorities have said that Uka confessed shortly after his capture at the airport to wanting to kill American troops because of the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan .

According to the indictment , Uka was radicalized over time by jihadist propaganda he saw on the Internet , and the night before the act had watched a video that purported to show American atrocities in Afghanistan ; it was actually a clip from a film . The investigation turned up no connections with any terrorist organization .

" He was a single person acting alone radicalized through jihadi Internet propaganda , " prosecutors ' spokesman Marcus Koehler told The Associated Press . " That shows , in the opinion of the federal prosecutors office , how dangerous jihadist propaganda on the Internet is . " 

Uka 's attorney , Jens Joerg Hoffmann , said his client gave detailed statements to authorities and does not dispute the facts of the indictment .

No pleas are entered in Germany , meaning when the trial begins the prosecutors will still have to lay out the facts for the court . Hoffmann said the best Uka can hope for because of his cooperation is for the judges to allow for the possibility of an early release after he serves 15 years .

" There are ample hard facts , ample witnesses , ample everything  what 's there to dispute ? " he told the AP in a telephone interview from Frankfurt .

The video Uka saw the day before the crime , entitled " what was done to our sisters , " was actually a short clip taken from the 2007 Brian De Palma anti-war film " Redacted , " Hoffmann said .

According to the indictment , Uka went to the airport armed with a pistol , extra ammunition and two knives .

Inside Terminal 2 , he spotted two U.S. servicemen who had just arrived on an afternoon flight and followed them to where a U.S. Air Force bus was waiting to pick them up .

After 16 servicemen , including the driver , were on or near the bus , Uka approached one of the men for a cigarette as a pretext to get closer , prosecutors said .

" After the person confirmed that these were members of the U.S. Air Force on their way to Afghanistan , the accused turned around , put the magazine that had been concealed in his backpack into his pistol , and cocked the weapon , " the indictment read .

He first shot unarmed Senior Airman Nicholas J . Alden , a 25 - year - old from South Carolina , in the back of the head , the indictment alleged . He then boarded the vehicle shouting " Allahu Akbar "  Arabic for " God is great "  and shot and killed the driver , 21 - year - old Airman 1st Class Zachary R . Cuddeback of Vigrinia , before firing at others on board .
