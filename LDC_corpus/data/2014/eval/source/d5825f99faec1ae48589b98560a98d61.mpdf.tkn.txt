i am nomadic by nature . i ca n't stay in one place for more than a couple months . i just ca n't . ever since i was old enough to figure out how to use public transportation by myself , i 've been taking off on whim to wherever .

and i have had legal troubles for the past four years . before , i was under 18 , so the cops kept bringing me back to my parents . and then i got arrested when i was 19 , and every time i stay put somewhere for too long , i get arrested again . my only crime EVER has been possession . and i have three felonies and too many misdemeanors to count . i am bad at being a " criminal " i guess . anarchist pheramones is all that i can think of to account for how i get caught so much . all i do is possess drugs ! i do n't steal or bother anybody .

anyway , i recently got out of prison . ( the worst part about going to prison was that they made me comb out my dreads to make sure i was n't smuggling something in in them . HA ! ) so anyway , i 'm on parole for a year . and i have to be in illinois for a year to complete parole . and i already bought a greyhound ticket to california . but i 'm trying to make myself stay here to complete parole . because parole is easy . all i have to do is call them from a land line every week . and if i 'm in another state , and a cop runs my name , it will show up that i 'm on parole , so i 'll violate and get sent back to prison . i 've already been extradited twice . it sucks .

so i wan na make myself stay here all year . it seems impossible . how do people do it ? even if i had a place in my name , it would be easy for me to just leave it to go somewhere for a while . because the same places get boring , and i need to travel . it 's in my blood . but if i complete parole , i might finally be free to travel without being a fugitive , and then i can just become transient indefinitly , and that 's my dream .

advice ?
