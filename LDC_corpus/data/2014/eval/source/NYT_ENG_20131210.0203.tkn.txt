KIEV , Ukraine - Ominous new action by Ukraine ’s security forces on Monday , including a raid on an opposition party ’s headquarters , appeared to diminish prospects for talks between the government and protest leaders , as Western officials grasped for a way to defuse the country ’s intensifying political crisis .

In a sign of mounting alarm , Vice President Joe Biden and President José Manuel Barroso of the European Commission each called Ukraine ’s besieged president , Viktor F . Yanukovych , to warn him against unleashing force on a mass demonstration movement in its third week . Senior envoys , including the European foreign affairs chief , Catherine Ashton , and an assistant secretary of state , Victoria Nuland , were dispatched in an effort to ease tensions .

The renewed diplomatic maneuvering was intended to prevent a repeat of the bloodshed during a violent crackdown by the police on Nov . 30 and to contain the widening civil uprising , which has plunged this nation of 46 million into deep uncertainty . Caught in a tug of war between European and Russian interests , Ukraine faces a severe economic crisis and is in immediate need of an aid package that is unlikely to materialize while thousands of protesters and riot police officers are massed in the streets .

In a meeting with senior Kremlin officials in Moscow on Monday , the State Department said , Nuland “ urged Russia to use its influence to press for peace , human dignity and a political solution ” and stressed Ukraine ’s need for “ a return to economic health with the support of the International Monetary Fund . ”

The authorities seemed to lose control of Kiev on Sunday night after a huge rally of hundreds of thousands of people in Independence Square . On Monday , police forces and Interior Ministry troops were redeployed and began efforts to push protesters out of streets near main government buildings , including the presidential headquarters . Battalions of officers moved in and took up positions just outside the square ’s perimeters , and by late Monday they had surrounded small encampments of protesters in the governmental quarter of the capital . After midnight , they began clearing those camps and cut off electricity to the occupied City Hall .

The party ’s parliamentary leader , Arseniy P . Yatsenyuk , is one of the main organizers of the protest movement , which ballooned in recent days to dominate the streets of Kiev and pressure Yanukovych after he refused to sign a political and trade pact with the European Union .
