@ ossobuco , 

Meanwhile , that ship captain 's entire family is likely being held and tortured into disavowing him as an American spy .

When countries cooperate in matters of international law , it can only be good thing . There was an interesting aricle on Iran in yesterday 's Guardian , which I 've already posted on another thread , but I 'll post it here as well .

In other words , confident statements by the White House and state department that Iran is buckling under sanctions pressure appear to blithely ignore the possibility that the regime is being pushed into a corner from which it will come out punching , not negotiating . One result may be an acceleration of its nuclear activities â€“ the opposite of what Obama wants . And then there is the unpredictable Gulf tinderbox . Fearing fatal insurrection at home and with their oil exports blocked , Khamenei and the mullahs , egged on by trigger - happy Revolutionary Guards , may choose to export chaos instead .
