'Hiccup girl ' seeks deal in killing 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
LARGO — ' 'Hiccup girl ’ ' Jennifer Mee , who is charged with first - degree murder , has offered to plead guilty to a lesser offense in exchange for a 15 - year prison sentence , her attorney John Trevena said in court Friday .
< / P> 
<P> 
Assistant State Attorney Christopher LaBruzzo said prosecutors would discuss the offer .

<P> 
Mee became known as the ' ' hiccup girl ’ ' in 2007 because of a case of hiccups that lasted months . A video of her hiccuping became an Internet sensation .
< / P> 
<P> 
But in 2010 , she was arrested along with two men and charged with murder . St. Petersburg police said the trio plotted to rob Shannon Griffin , 22 , who was found shot to death at a vacant home just north of downtown .

<P> 
Mee and the others have each been charged with first - degree murder and face mandatory life sentences without parole .

<P> 
Prosecutors have indicated some willingness to agree to a plea bargain , but perhaps not on terms the defendants would accept . They previously agreed to let Mee ’s co-defendant Laron Cordale Raiford plead guilty in exchange for a 40 - year prison sentence , but he turned the offer down . He is 22 .

In Mee ’s case , Trevena said he is eager to hear from prosecutors about the suggested 15 - year prison sentence . He said he had made previous offers which prosecutors rejected . First , he sought to get Mee designated as a ' ' youthful offender ’ ' with a six - year sentence . Prosecutors also turned down an offer for Mee to get a 10 - year prison sentence .

<P> 
Also on Friday , attorneys discussed testimony from a witness who at one point said one of the defendants , Lamont Antonio Newton , 25 , was the one who actually shot Griffin .

<P> 
But prosecutors do n’t necessarily need to prove that . Under Florida law , someone can be convicted of murder if he or she committed a serious felony crime — such as robbery — and someone was killed as a result . That ’s exactly what happened in this case , according to police .
< / P> 
<P> 
Attorneys also discussed possible June trial dates for Mee in case discussions over a plea agreement fall through . The trial originally was scheduled for this month , but will be delayed because of an illness in the family of one of the prosecutors .
< / P> 
<P> 
Mee ’s trial will be conducted separately from her two co-defendants , Newton and Raiford .
