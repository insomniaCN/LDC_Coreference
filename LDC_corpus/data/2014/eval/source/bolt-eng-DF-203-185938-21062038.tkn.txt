I had an episode of Say Yes To The Dress : Atlanta on my DVR where the bride and groom met for the first time AT THEIR WEDDING . They met online and skyped 8 hours a day for 5 months and then decided to get married . She went dress shopping 8 days before the wedding and ended up with a bright red poofy dress .
What if he smelled ? What if she HATED the way he did things that she never saw on Skype like loud chewing , snoring , farting .... ??? There are SO many things that could go wrong .
CRAZY .

I would be curious to see if they last . It 'd be sweet if they stayed together but I am sure nobody would be surprised if they split . That 's interesting , but I ca n't really knock it - because I 'd never try it , haha .

I mean , kudos to the people out there who make it work , but the thought terrifies me . My parents went through a phase of seriously researching arranged marriages and it was reason kabillionty twelve I was OUT of there as soon as humanly possible . Just ... no.

He lives in Ohio and she lives somewhere near Atlanta where the show is filmed . They did not talk about religion at all so I 'm not sure that it was a factor . She is 35 . They did n't say how old he is .

It happens all the time in other cultures . I guess it depends on your expectations of a relationship .

I agree . It might work well because they are going into it with different expectations that most of us have .
