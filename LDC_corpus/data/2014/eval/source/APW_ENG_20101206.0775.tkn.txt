Prosecutors on Monday told a judge presiding over an unusual court hearing on the constitutionality of the death penalty in Texas that they wo n't participate in the legal proceeding and will " stand mute " during the hearing .
< / P> 
<P> 
Despite the prosecution 's actions , the judge ordered the hearing to go forward and lawyers for John Edward Green Jr . , the Houston man who asked for the proceeding , began calling witnesses .
< / P> 
<P> 
The attorneys say will try to show that the way death penalty cases are handled in Texas creates a risk that innocent people will be executed . Green faces a possible death sentence if convicted of fatally shooting a Houston woman during a June 2008 robbery .
< / P> 
<P> 
The hearing was ordered by Kevin Fine , a state district judge in Harris County who in the spring granted a motion by Green 's attorneys and declared the state 's death penalty statute unconstitutional . Under heavy criticism , Fine clarified then rescinded his ruling and ordered the hearing , saying he needed to hear evidence on the issue .
< / P> 
<P> 
Experts on eyewitness identification , confessions and forensic evidence are among those expected to testify at the hearing , which could last up to two weeks .
< / P> 
<P> 
The first witness called was Richard Dieter , the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center , a Washington , D . C . - based group that has been critical of capital punishment .
< / P> 
<P> 
Dieter discussed the 138 exonerations of death row inmates that have occurred in the U.S. since 1978 , including 12 in Texas . He said that for every nine executions that have occurred in the U.S. , there has been one exoneration .
< / P> 
<P> 
Dieter said his group 's review of these exonerations has shown that faulty eyewitness testimony , unreliable informant testimony and false confessions are some of the factors that have contributed to innocent people being wrongfully convicted .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The system , the number ( of exonerations ) , the fortuity of finding mistakes would lead me to believe there is certainly a risk of executing the innocent and that risk still exists today , " he said .
< / P> 
<P> 
After Green 's attorneys finished questioning Dieter , Fine asked prosecutor Alan Curry if he had any questions .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We still respectfully refuse to participate in the proceeding your honor , " Curry said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Later during the hearing , Fine told Curry he expected prosecutors to participate .
< / P> 
<P> 
" I have been instructed by my boss , the district attorney , to stand mute for the remainder of the proceedings , " Curry said , adding he meant no disrespect to Fine or others involved in the hearing .
< / P> 
<P> 
Before the hearing began , Curry reiterated objections prosecutors have had to the hearing , saying the issues being debated are settled case law and that some of the issues Green 's attorneys plan to discuss at the hearing , such as crime clearance rates and alleged racial discrimination in how juries are chosen , have no relevance to Green 's case . Fine asked Curry to submit his objections to the relevancy of some of the issues to be discussed but said the hearing would go forward .
