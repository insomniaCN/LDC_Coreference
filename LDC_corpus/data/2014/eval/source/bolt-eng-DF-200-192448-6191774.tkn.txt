How many dictators are there in this picture ?

Hot on the heels of the Great Leap Forwardesque " Big Society " we have : <a href= " http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-my-war-on-multiculturalism-2205074.html">Cameron: My war on multiculturalism . No funding for Muslim groups that fail to back women 's rights . < / a> 

A little voice at the back of the class might mutter : " Muslim groups do n't need funding because they get all that oil money from Saudi Arabia " . What this will do though is stop Christian groups getting any money unless they spout radical feminism . And since there are far more Christian groups this policy to implement the cultural supremacism of " Muscular Liberalism " is essentially anti-Christian .

Hence the need to ask the question :

There are three dictators in that picture .

A loosely democratically elected leader of a majority coalition who can be democratically jettisoned after a few years by a large amount of people is not a dictator just because his policy chooses to halt public funding for groups which do n't treat women with respect .

Depends on your definition of ' elected ' . And also whether you can be both elected and a dictator .

David Cameron was elected by the people of Witney . There is , however , not really any such thing as an " elected Prime Minister " . That seems a rather semantic argument though .

Adolf Hitler was originally elected , as well as supported by trade unions .

The Bolsheviks in Russia did originally have some sort of elected political base .

Mao , as far as I 'm aware , was never elected .

Is there any modern comparison at all between David Cameron and the other 3 ? No. Do I understand what the OP 's post is even about ? No.

So *** * ing stupid . A democratically elected leader who wants extremist Muslim groups to respect women 's rights and various other rights stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .

Oh what am I thinking ! He sounds exactly like *** * ing Mao !

None of these distinctions are relevant . You might want to have a look at some commonly accepted definitions of ' <a href= " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictatorship">dictatorship</a> '. Dictatorships can be initially elected . Non-elected Prime Ministers in our UK Parliamentary system can not be dictators , assuming the laws are abided .

So no , it does n't depend on your definition of ' elected ' . You 've reached the same conclusion as me , but your reasoning is irrelevant , imo .

All four are dictators . If you do n't think Cameron is a dictactor , just ask yourself why he pleads for the people to " give something back " and " contribute to society " when he himself has given nothing back and has contributed nothing except to push his own agenda ?

A dictator assumes absolute power , hence why I would argue you ca n't be elected and a dictator - you were popularly supported to have that power .

To call David Cameron a dictator is to belittle the suffering of the oppressed citizens in countries actually under the thumb of real dictators .

Actually , I 'm with Cameron on this one . Reactionary religious groups do n't deserve our money . This is Britain , we believe in liberalism and equality for all .

I deeply dislike words like dictator . There is only power , even those with immense amounts of power are constrained by what their society will tolerate . Is a man who gets his way the entire time by pursuing an agenda within the bounds of his society more of a dictator than a man who only gets his way a small amount of the time but pushes the boundaries ? 

What about a weak leader surrounded by men who otherwise agree with his agenda . Although he is weak , his agenda is still implemented .

I personally think Cameron is my weak leader description . He is weak and personally can not be called a powerful man in any meaningful sense of the word - but he is a figurehead for an ideology that has a powerful grip on the nation due to no opposition ( Labour , LibDems and Conservatives are effectively different wings of the same party ) .

Martyn does it yet again .

Being a hypocrite is not the same thing as being a dictator . You 're well on your way to holding the same level of credibility as Teveth .

P . S .

As for Cameron 's position regarding money for religious groups - they should n't have any period and any advocating religious extremism should just be deported to Somalia .

< / quote> 

Cameron wants a world where women do n't have a choice about what kind of woman they want to be . That indeed is jackboot territory .

" Women 's rights " does not mean " a culture good for women " or even " made for women , by women " . It 's a specific culture that benefits the ruling elite - who incidentally , ignore the strictures of equality in their own lives , for example by sending their kids to sex segregated schools - by wrecking the families and life opportunities of the poor .

The new policy is not about fighting Muslim extremism - radical Islamists like wahabbis are funded from abroad , not the state - but about reducing the flow of money to Christian charities and organisations , because Christianity , Jesus 's message of love , threatens the one world culture of permanent war of dictators like Cameron .

LOL if you say so .

Personally I think he just does n't approve of marginalizing women in the name of Islam , but each to their own .

I never suggested a Prime Minister in a parliamentary system could be a dictator in such circumstances . Instead I was trying to pre-empt any suggestions to the contrary , based exactly on that flawed reasoning .

You can hardly put Cameron on the same level as Hitler , Stalin or Mao and I doubt you ever will be able to . There 's a very good chance that Cameron will never gain absolute power and could never become a dictator . I do n't think what he said means that you can justify calling him a dictator . He is many things but a dictator he is not .
