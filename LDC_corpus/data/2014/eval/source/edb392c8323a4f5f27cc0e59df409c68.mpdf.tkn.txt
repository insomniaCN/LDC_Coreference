Afghan may face death for alleged conversion 

A man in Afghanistan is being prosecuted in a Kabul court and could be sentenced to death after being charged with converting from Islam to Christianity , a crime under the country 's Islamic sharia laws , a judge said Sunday .

The trial highlights a struggle between religious conservatives and reformists over what shape Islam will take here four years after the ouster of the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban regime .

The defendant , Abdul Rahman , 41 , was arrested last month after his family accused him of becoming a Christian , according to Judge Ansarullah Mawlavezada . Rahman was charged with rejecting Islam . His trial started Thursday .
