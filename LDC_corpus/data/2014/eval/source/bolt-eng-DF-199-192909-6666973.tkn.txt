US Confirms Israeli Strikes Hit Syrian Target Last Week 
US Confirms Israeli Strikes Hit Syrian Target Last Week 
By Mark Mazzetti and Helene Cooper 
The New York Times 
Wednesday 12 September 2007 

Washington - After days of silence from the Israeli government , American officials confirmed Tuesday that Israeli warplanes launched airstrikes inside Syria last week , the first such attack since 2003 .

A Defense Department official said Israeli jets had struck at least one target in northeastern Syria last Thursday , but the official said it was still unclear exactly what the jets hit and the extent of the bombing damage .

Syria has lodged a protest at the United Nations in response to the airstrike , accusing Israel of " flagrant violation " of its airspace . But Israel 's government has repeatedly declined to comment on the matter .

Officials in Washington said that the most likely targets of the raid were weapons caches that Israel 's government believes Iran has been sending the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah through Syria . Iran and Syria are Hezbollah 's primary benefactors , and American intelligence officials say a steady flow of munitions from Iran runs through Syria and into Lebanon .

In the summer of 2006 , during fighting between Israeli and Hezbollah forces , the militant group fired hundreds of missiles into Israel , surprising Israel with the extent and sophistication of its arsenal . Israel has tried repeatedly to get the United Nations to prevent the arms shipments across the Syria - Lebanon border .

One Bush administration official said Israel had recently carried out reconnaissance flights over Syria , taking pictures of possible nuclear installations that Israeli officials believed might have been supplied with material from North Korea . The administration official said Israeli officials believed that North Korea might be unloading some of its nuclear material on Syria .

" The Israelis think North Korea is selling to Iran and Syria what little they have left , " the official said . He said it was unclear whether the Israeli strike had produced any evidence that might validate that belief .

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing a military action by another government .

In a letter circulated to members of the Security Council on Tuesday , Syria 's ambassador to the United Nations , Bashar Jaafari , said Israel dropped munitions though they did not cause any " material damage . " 

Syria made its protest via Qatar , the Arab representative on the Security Council , United Nations officials said . Security Council representatives discussed the issue on Tuesday , but did not come to any conclusions .

Neither Israel nor the United States has spoken publicly on the airstrikes . The State Department spokesman , Sean D . McCormack , referred all questions to Israel and Syria , and a spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington declined to comment .

Tensions between Israel and Syria have escalated over the past year , since the end of the Israel - Hezbollah war in Lebanon , and both countries remain in a heightened state of alert along their common border .

Syria 's president , Bashar al - Assad , has said that if Israel is not willing to resume negotiations for the return of the Golan Heights , which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab - Israeli war , the alternative would be to try to regain the territory by force .

Formal peace talks between Israel and Syria broke down in 2000 .

Israel 's opposition leader , Binyamin Netanyahu , has given the first confirmation from his country of a mysterious air strike on an unknown target deep in Syria earlier this month - fuelling frenzied speculation about exactly what happened .

The leader of the rightwing Likud party said he had given the prime minister , Ehud Olmert , his backing for the attack , which Damascus said took place on September 6 . Before that , the Israeli government had enforced a news blackout on the story .

Asked during a TV interview , Mr Netanyahu said : " When a prime minister does something that is important and necessary to Israel 's security ... I give my backing . " He refused to give further details .

Fury as Netanyahu confirms Syria strike 
By Donald Macintyre in Jerusalem 
Published : 21 September 2007 
Independent UK 

Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the right - wing opposition party Likud , was chacteristically at the centre of a controversy yesterday after appearing to be the first Israeli politician to confirm an air strike against Syria two weeks ago .

With reporting in Israel covoered by military censorship , Mr Netanyahu startled television viewers - and reportedly shocked the office of the Prime Minister , Ehud Olmert - by answering a question about the supposed air strike in an interview .

Mr Netanyahu , a former prime minister , infuriated some of his political opponents by telling Channel One television that he was " party " to the operation on which he had personally congratulated Olmert . He declared " When the Prime Minister takes action in important and necessary matters , and generally when the government is doing things for the security of Israel , I give it my endorsement . I was party to this matter , I must say , from the first minute and I gave it my backing , but it is still too early to discuss this subject . " Israel 's government has maintained a studious , and unusual , silence since Syria first complained about an incursion into its airspace .

The row came as US President George Bush - while refusing to confirm what US officials have been anonymously briefing for more than a week was a strike on a suspected nuclear facility built with North Korean help - warned against nuclear prolifetration by North Korea .

Eitan Cabel , secretary general of the Labour Party , told Army Radio that Mr Netanyahu had been guilty of " an outburst that is severe , stupid and irresponsible " . Mr Cabel , whose party leader , Ehud Barak , is seen by his supporters as the main rival to Mr Netanyahu for the future premiership , declared : " Bibi [ Mr Netanyahu 's nickname ] is the same Bibi . I haven no idea if it is foolishness , stupidity , the desire to jump on the bandwagon , the desire to be a partner , to steal credit - or something else . It is simply very dangerous . The man simply does not deserve to lead . " 

An anonymous official said to be close to Mr Olmert was quoted in the Haaretz newspaper as saying : " Bibi 's slip of the tongue borders on national irresponsibility . Once again Netanyahu could n't restrain himself and he ran to tell the guys . " 

The political row - fuelled by party divisions - followed a declaration by Shimon Peres , the Israeli President , on Tuesday that the tensions caused by the incident were " over " and the government was prepared for talks with Syria aimed at ending the 40 years of emnity between the two countries since Israel captured the Golan heights in the Six Day War in 1967 .

Some right - wing politicians went to Mr Netanyahu 's defence , with the Likud Knesset member Yuval Steinitz saying : " Netanyahu 's statements were unfortunate , but they caused no harm . This is a tempest in a tea cup . " 

Ehud Barak - who has refrained from any comment either on the supposed Israeli operation or on Mr Netanyahu 's comments , said : " It is a pity that the aides of the worst prime minister in the history of the state seek out every opportunity to incite against Netanyahu , and permit themselves to use language that is lowly and contemptible , albeit typical . " 

Meanwhile the European Union is calling on Israel to consider tighter sanctions on Gaza by cutting power and fuel in response to Qassam rocket attacks . Javier Solana , the EU foreign affairs chief , said : " We join the call by the secretary general of the United Nations for the Israeli government to reconsider its decision . " 

The European Commission , which helped coordinate emergency aid to Palestinians after the election victory of the militant Islamist group Hamas prompted the West to suspend direct aid to the territories , also urged Israel to reconsider . " The Commission hopes that Israel will not find it necessary to implement the measures for which the decisions set the framework yesterday , " a spokeswoman for the EU executive said . The United Nations secretary general , Ban Ki - moon , urged Israel on Wednesday to reconsider its decision to declare the Gaza Strip a hostile territory , warning that any cut - off of vital services would violate international law and punish the already suffering civilian population . Mr Ban said he was very concerned at the Israeli government 's " announced intent to interrupt essential services such as electricity and fuel to the civilian population " .

Syria strike : US shared intelligence with Israel 
Syria strike : US shared intelligence with Israel 
By Leonard Doyle in Washington 
Published : 22 September 2007 
Independent UK 

Before it bombed Syria , Israel provided the US with intelligence suggesting that North Korea was secretly supplying Damascus with nuclear technology , The Washington Post newspaper claimed yesterday .

However , there is considerable scepticism of the intelligence that prompted Israel 's attack , with some proliferation experts querying whether Syria is even attempting to acquire nuclear weapons . The quality of the Israeli intelligence is also unknown , as is the extent of North Korean co-operation . Some people have suggested that a North Korean ship merely unloaded items it no longer needed .

The Bush administration has not commented on the Israeli raid or the details of the intelligence , which President George Bush was handed during the summer . The US reportedly corroborated some of the original intelligence it received from Israel , but fears remained that any immediate action would bring an end to negotiations aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme .

The target of the Israeli bombers was reported to be in northern Syria , near the Turkish border . To maintain secrecy , the details of the mission were given to the pilots who conducted the attack only after they were in the air , the newspaper said .

The Israeli intelligence included satellite images , according to anonymous sources quoted by the paper . Most details about the alleged North Korean - Syrian connection remain unknown .

At a press conference on Thursday , President Bush refused to answer questions about Israel 's air strikes in Syria . " I 'm not going to comment on the matter , " Mr Bush said .

Israel is also refusing to discuss the raid , although Benjamin Netanyahu , the leader of the Likud party , told Israeli television that he knew of the operation . In Syria , officials said its air defence forced Israel 's jets to flee . It has also warned that it may retaliate .

Syria has denied receiving North Korean nuclear technology and Pyongyang has also denied any such deal .

Israeli air strike on Syria shrouded in secrecy as speculation mounts about the target 
Washington wo n't comment on reports that North Korea was helping Damascus build a nuclear weapon 
SONIA VERMA 

Special to The Globe and Mail 

September 22 , 2007 

JERUSALEM -- It began as a mysterious mission into enemy land , but is quickly becoming Israel 's worst kept secret .

When Syria announced two weeks ago that its forces had opened fire on an Israeli aircraft that had infiltrated its airspace and bombed its territory , some dismissed it as a far - fetched Syrian conspiracy theory .

Others feared it could lead to the start of all - out war between the two archenemies .

But over the past couple of weeks , in dribs and drabs , a theory has emerged : A North Korean ship had arrived in Syria carrying clandestine cargo destined for a facility near the Turkish border that was part of a nascent nuclear weapons program . North Korean nuclear experts were rumoured to be in Syria at the time , and Israel decided to attack .

The truth is , Israeli officials wo n't divulge the motive behind the Syrian operation . Most wo n't even acknowledge it happened , maintaining an unusual " wall of silence " in a country where such secrets often seep out .

And a rare media blackout imposed by Israeli authorities on local journalists has prevented those best placed to find out the truth from reporting it . Any journalist who breaks the code of silence could face jail time .

The censorship means most accounts of what really happened the night of Sept . 6 come from unnamed sources , state news agencies and anonymous Internet blogs . This has n't slowed speculation over exactly what did happen - the most contentious theory being the joint nuclear project .

Those reports are now raising tensions between the old rivals to dangerous new levels .

" This comes at a time when there is already a lot of fear about a war with Syria , " said one Israeli military observer , who did not want to be named because of the media blackout .

" What we have now is a lot of conjecture and not a lot of facts . People are accusing Syria of many things . And if we 're not careful those accusations could become self - fulfilling prophecies , " the observer said .

After the air strike , Israel remained uncharacteristically silent , flatly denying its warplanes were even involved in an operation - until this week when Benjamin Netanyahu , Israel 's hawkish opposition leader , broke that silence with an apparent slip of the tongue .

Asked during a television interview to comment on " that operation that is so cloaked in secrecy , " he said : " I was privy to the matter from the outset and I gave my backing . But it 's too early to be discussing this . " 

His comments , however cryptic , were the first official admission that something in Syria was targeted . But rumours were already rife about what the air raid involved .

One guess was that the attack was a shot over the bow - meant to test the readiness of Syria 's anti-missile defence capabilities . Another story holds that Israel targeted a conventional - weapons transfer to Hezbollah .

Yet another posits the attack was an assassination attempt on Khaled Meshaal , leader - in - exile of the militant Hamas movement .

" At the end of the day , each of those theories is as good as the next one . Those who know the truth think secrecy is the best way to handle the truth and we have to trust them , " said Yaakov Amidror , former deputy chief of intelligence for the Israeli Army .

Most Israelis agree . According to polls , most say they feel safer since Sept . 6 and believe the operation was a success .

A week after the air strike , Israel 's chief of military intelligence told the Knesset that Israel 's " deterrence capabilities " had been restored .

He pointedly refused to comment about a specific mission in Syria , but his remarks were reassuring to the Israeli public , whose faith in their military was badly shaken by last year 's failed war with Hezbollah in Lebanon .

" The public assumes something was done and accepts that it should n't be discussed for their own protection . They feel comforted knowing the army succeeded at something , " said Uzi Arad , director of the Institute for Policy and Strategy at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Centre and a former intelligence director for the Mossad , Israel 's intelligence agency .

Others believe Israel 's silence is strategic in other ways .

" The silence , for Israel is a very smart move . As long as they keep things quiet , the target can be whatever they want it to be , " one local analyst said of Israel 's relations with Syria .

Yesterday , Washington declined comment on reports the target of the Israeli raid was a nuclear facility built with a North Korean help .

" There are lots of things that we know about and learn about in this building that we do n't share with you from this podium , " White House spokesman Tony Fratto said .

Syria has denounced what it calls U.S. " lies " that it was receiving nuclear material from North Korea .

Pyongyang has denied helping Syria , insisting it is honouring an earlier pledge forbidding the transfer of nuclear material as part of a deal brokered in six - party talks in February that won the communist state diplomatic concessions .

Experts point out that it simply does n't make sense that North Korea would jeopardize that agreement by shipping nuclear weapons to Syria .

But here in Israel , despite stubborn official silence -- the story refuses to die .

" There is a feeling the story will get out sooner or later , " Mr. Arad said .

" It 's not that people think the story will be buried forever , but these days the truth is a matter of time . " 

Strike force 

Israel has more sophisticated military capabilities than any of its neighbours , able to strike targets thousands of kilometres away before its enemies can effectively react .

TALL AL ABYAD AL ATIQ , SYRIA 

Agricultural research centre Israel may have bombed earlier this month , possibly suspecting Syria was using it as part of a nuclear weapons program .

OSIRAK , IRAQ 

Nuclear materials testing reactor Israel destroyed in 1981 , suspecting it would be used to produce weapons .

NATANZ , IRAN 

Uranium enrichment facility Israel and the United States suspect is used for nuclear weapons purposes .

PLANES 

F - 15L / F - 16L : When fitted with long - range fuel tanks , Israel 's most advanced strike jets are capable of hitting targets 2,225 km away .

MISSILES 

Jericho III : Less is known about Israel 's missile capabilities , but it 's thought that its latest such weapon can strike targets at least 4,800 km away .
