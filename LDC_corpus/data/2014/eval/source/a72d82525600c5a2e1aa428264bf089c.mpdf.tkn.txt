this is a new movie that premiered the other day at Sundance . It stars John Cusack as a right winger whose wife has been killed in action over in Iraq . Instead of telling his two daughters about the death of their mother , he instead puts that off , and decides to take them on a road trip .

The movie has gotten incredible buzz and was bought by Harvey Weinstein and company the first day it premiered , for a reported 4 million .

The reviews of this movie seem to be pretty chilling . One reviewer talked about how instead of making a movie about the horrors of actual combat and the horrors of war , this film does what few movies I can think of at least in the war film genre seem to ever do : it focuses on wars effects on family members .

One reviewer talked about how " the pain and terror in Cusacks face ( while trying to tell his daughters ) never leaves " .

I think this film really is something special and ca nt wait to see it . This could be one hell of a movie .
