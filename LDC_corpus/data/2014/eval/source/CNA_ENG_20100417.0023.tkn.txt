The travel plans of some 2,000 Taiwanese were affected as a hazardous cloud of 
volcanic ash from Iceland forced the closure of airports and the delay or 
cancellation of many flights in Europe , Taiwan tourism authorities said 
Saturday .

According to the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation and 
Communications , 12 local travel agencies were affected by the chaos , while a 
total of 70 tour groups organized by the agencies were either stranded in Europe

According to local travel agencies , tours to Europe have been popular since the 
beginning of the year , with a 30 percent increase in the number of tour groups 
recorded in the first few months compared to the same period last year . The 
tourists were mostly retired people and newly wedded couples , they added .

Most of the travel agencies affected by the volcanic eruption in Iceland said 
they could do nothing but face their losses because it was an unpredictable 
natural disaster .

Chen Shu - chuang of the Travel Quality Assurance Association acknowledged that 
although the tour packages were all insured , the payments would not be enough to 
cover the losses .

The insurance companies will pay only NT $ 2,000 a day for each traveler stranded 
in Europe , but the cost of food and accommodation there is more than NT $ 4,000 
per person per day , he said . This means the travel agencies will have to meet 
the difference , he added .
