I know some people in the area and the shooter has severe diabetes and was recently treated for cancer . He is in the hospital and may not live to stand trial . He probably had no business behind the wheel , much less behind a firearm .

What a sick person . I hope he is never let out of prison . He has taken away a father and husband from a loving family because of his own poor self control .
