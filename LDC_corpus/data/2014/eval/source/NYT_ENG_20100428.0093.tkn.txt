<P> 
Continental Airlines board of directors met Wednesday to 
discuss a merger with United Airlines , a person familiar with the 
situation said .
< / P> 
<P> 
That meeting likely indicates the two airlines are making 
progress in their talks , which earlier this week were reportedly 
bogged down over price issues related to an all - stock transaction .
< / P> 
<P> 
Another Continental board meeting is likely in the next several 
days .
< / P> 
<P> 
Speculation in and around the industry is increasing that the 
two airlines will , in fact , get a deal done . And that it could come 
as soon as this weekend .
< / P> 
<P> 
" It clearly indicates they are in pretty advanced stages , " 
said Hunter Keay , an airline analyst with Stifel Nicolaus said of 
word that Continental 's board had met . " I would n't be surprised if 
we have an announcement relatively soon . There 's going to be some 
long nights this weekend without a doubt . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Some details have already emerged , including that Continental 's 
CEO , Chairman and President Jeff Smisek would serve as the CEO of a 
merged carrier and that United 's CEO , Chairman and President Glenn 
Tilton would be non-executive chairman . The merged carrier - to be 
called United - would be based in Chicago .
< / P> 
<P> 
Neither airline has publicly confirmed the merger talks .
Spokeswoman at both airlines declined comment again Wednesday .
< / P> 
<P> 
Continental and United held merger talks in 2008 but Continental 
ended them .
< / P> 
<P> 
Continental and United restarted merger discussions earlier this 
month after United again courted Tempe , Ariz . - based US Airways .
Last week , the negotiations with US Airways were called off .
< / P> 
<P> 
If United and Continental marry , the new airline will be the 
nation 's largest carrier , eclipsing Delta Air Lines , which merged 
with Northwest Airlines in 2008 .
< / P> 
<P> 
Continental 's shares closed up 55 cents at $ 22.17 Wednesday and 
United 's closed up $ 1.24 to $ 21.75 .
< / P> 
<P> 
An airline industry expert said airline officials want to make a 
decision about whether to merge as soon as possible .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Uncertainty is nobody 's friend . You want to get this resolved 
as quickly as you can . Your whole organization is in limbo , which 
is not good for anybody , " said the industry observer .
< / P> 
<P> 
Meanwhile , local city and business leaders are continuing to 
reach out to Continental and United to make the case to locate the 
merged company 's headquarters in Houston .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Greater Houston Partnership and mayor have reached out - 
through letters and calls - to both airlines bosses . And they 've 
received no response yet , they said during an editorial board 
meeting Wednesday at the Houston Chronicle .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Our concern is we remain the headquarters for a lot reasons 
beyond simply what might in effect be a few hundred jobs going one 
way or another , " Mayor Annise Parker said . " We believe in the 
long run it 's better for the airport . It 's better for the city of 
Houston , and what we 've had is a number of one way conversations . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Parker said she hopes the operational headquarters remain in 
Houston , even if the paper headquarters moves to Chicago .
< / P> 
<P> 
" That 's where the power is , " she said , adding that if 
Continental 's management team leads the merged airline , it would 
make sense to keep the headquarters in Houston .
