The State Department has cleared the way for the return to the United States of two prominent Muslim scholars once accused of having ties to terrorism , a spokesman said Wednesday .
< / P> 
<P> 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has signed orders enabling the re-entry of professors Tariq Ramadan of Oxford University in England and Adam Habib of the University of Johannesburg in South Africa once they obtain required admittance documents , department spokesman Darby Holladay said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Clinton " has chosen to exercise her exemption authority for the benefit of Tariq Ramadan and Adam Habib , " Holladay said . " We 'll let that action speak for itself . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
In a prepared statement , Holladay noted the change in U.S. posture since both professors , who are frequently invited to the United States to lecture , were denied admittance after making statements counter to U.S. foreign policy .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Both the president and the secretary of state have made it clear that the U.S. government is pursuing a new relationship with Muslim communities based on mutual interest and mutual respect , " Holladay said . The decision was made after consultations with the departments of Homeland Security and Justice , he added .
< / P> 
<P> 
The American Civil Liberties Union sued in recent years to challenge the exclusion of the professors . It said the State Department 's action means the scholars will now get visas within weeks of requesting them .
< / P> 
<P> 
The orders are " long overdue and tremendously important , " said Jameel Jaffer , director of the ACLU National Security Project .
< / P> 
<P> 
Habib , a well - known South African scholar who has criticized the war in Iraq , was denied a visa by the U.S. government in a letter saying he " engaged in a terrorist activity , " an accusation Habib has vigorously denied .
< / P> 
<P> 
The ACLU of Massachusetts sued in 2007 , challenging Habib 's exclusion on behalf of the American Sociological Association , the American Association of University Professors , the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Boston Coalition for Palestinian Rights .
< / P> 
<P> 
Ramadan , 47 , had his U.S. visa revoked in 2004 as he was about to move to Indiana to take a tenured teaching job at the University of Notre Dame . He has spoken at Harvard and Stanford universities and elsewhere .
< / P> 
<P> 
Later , his visa applications were denied on the grounds that he had donated $ 1,336 to a charity that gave money to Hamas , an Islamic militant group that has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. Ramadan has said he has no connections to terrorism , opposes Islamic extremism and promotes peaceful solutions .
< / P> 
<P> 
Ramadan said in a statement issued by PEN American Center , a human rights group , that he was " very pleased with the decision to end my exclusion from the United States after almost six years . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
He said he was looking forward to visiting the United States soon , and PEN said it planned to organize a forum in New York where he could speak .
< / P> 
<P> 
In an ACLU statement , Habib said he was thrilled , calling it a victory both personal and " for democracy around the world . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Habib , 44 , lived in the United States from 1993 - 95 while earning a doctorate in political science from the City University of New York . He said he had been excluded since October 2006 , when he was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials about his political views and was asked whether he belonged to or supported any terrorist organizations .
< / P> 
<P> 
In a 2007 interview with The Associated Press , Habib called the U.S. approach to the Iraq war a disaster . He also said : I 'm confident that I ca n't be linked to things like terrorism . That is not what my politics is about . "
