A retired British businessman has been handed over to US marshals at Heathrow to be extradited to the United States to face charges that he illegally exported weapons parts to Iran . Christopher Tappin , who is 65 and lives in Kent , will be escorted across the Atlantic today . He was being accompanied by his tearful wife Elaine .
Tappin , who said he was full of trepidation about his fate , denies any wrongdoing and says he is the innocent victim of a sting operation by US agents .
He is being extradited under a controversial treaty signed off in 2003 by both the US and UK governments , which allows American prosecutors to demand British suspects are handed over without their cases ever being tested in a British court .
Today he labelled his treatment a " disgrace " as he arrived at Heathrow police station . " I look to ( Prime Minister David ) Cameron to look after my rights and he has failed to do so .
" I have no rights . Abu Qatada is walking the streets of London today and we can not extradite him . He has more rights than I have .
" If I was a terrorist I would not be going to America . I think it 's a shame , a disgrace .
" The Conservative government , while in opposition , promised to reform the law and they failed to do so and they 've let me down , they 've let you down , they 've let the whole country down . " 
< / quote> 

This was interesting - even after he fought against it in UK+European Courts , he 's still being extradited :

<a href= " http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/16148502">Tappin fought extradition for years , but both the UK and Europeans courts said that he could be extradited . < / a> 
< / quote> 

Now , I 'm not here to hysterically scream ' outrageous ' etc etc and it is not greatly an issue whether he did or did not do what he is accused of .

However , it is a cause for concern regarding the circumstances in which the American authorities are allowed to take our citizens .

Does this go both ways ? May the UK also demand extradition of an American citizen ? 

And the HRA 1998 / ECHR can not help any citizens of this country at all in being extradited ? Is this not some breach of rights ? 

It was mentioned in the article that this so - called treaty rendered the British authorities and lawyers powerless to try to stop it - really ? 

Incidentally , if he is successfully charged and loses his case , which prison will he be imprisoned in - a British or an American one ? 

So for example , if I were to suspected by the American authorities of doing something dubious related to them , say for example , purchasing a machine gun with the supposed intent to supply it to Iran , could I simply be extradited such as this man ? 

Thus , either there is something seriously wrong here with the UK in this matter , or there is some below - the - limelight corruption and Mr Tappin is caught up in it .... ? 

Your thoughts on this matter ?

This is not breaking news for starters . I do feel sorry for him , American prisons are inhumane and animalistic . I do nt know how a country like the UK can agree to this . But that s what you get for living in United Britain .

The treaty between the US - UK is ridiculous . They would nt like it if we wanted to extradite a US citizen .
British justice for British citizens !

This is a bit odd ... they have been on Babar Ahmad 's case for ages and he has been in prison for 6 years without a charge . He is too a British citizen , but i guess because he is a Pakistani he deserves less attention then a white British citizen . So much for the rule of law

Why does the article say the case was not tested in British courts but then that he fought extradition for years ? Surely by fighting extradition the nature of the case and if a crime has been committed is going to come up ? I do n't like this that much or the treaty but in this case I do n't see there being much difference between him being tried here or in the US . Either way he is going to get his day in court and a chance to defend himself .

But the laws in the US or different from the laws in the UK , though they may both be common law jurisdictions . What if I , being a British citizen , murdered an American citizen who was on holiday in the UK . Surely , I would and should be tried in a UK court ? 

But what if I , being a British citizen , hired another British citizen to kill an American citizen on US soil ? Who gets to charge me for the crime ? Supposedly my hitman will be deported or something ; but me ? 

I think this calls for extensive research ....

Surely you would be though ? Is it not fair that if you killed an American in the US or took actions that primarily hurt the US that you stand trial there ? 

As for the latter example you would both be deported .

The point is the law gives us no home rights and the conservative government has done nothing about it .

Glad I 'm leaving UK when I graduate .

this is n't even a case of a crime being committed in or against america by the sound of it , so I do n't quite understand why they feel the need to try him there . I mean , at least the guy who hacked the pentagon actually committed a crime against the US government . this guys crime affects us as much as the US , he should be tried here

words do nt even begin to describe how angry stories like this make me ... its obscene , he 's an elderly retired business man who sold batteries ? ! he did nt sell the iranians plans for a nuclear war head , he did nt sell them missile designs , its a battery ... the Americans and their backward and perverted ' justice ' system are making an example out of him just like the chap who was arrested for tvbox or whatever the site was called a couple of weeks back ... this extradition treaty needs scrapping , no civilised nation would dare send their citizens to a country like america to be dumped over in their justice system , least of all for such petty crimes as this ... we deport pensioners but let terrorists walk the streets of london , very eloquently put by this poor gentleman .

We should have asked the Americans to extradite all the US citizens involved in selling weapons to the IRA .

to me this sounds a bit fishy , i work for company that exports materials for use in military applications and the rules are really strict and obvious . For example you ca nt even export 1g of something that might have a use in a military application without a license and all these things are written down and have to be to comply with the law . I personally do n't see how its possible to export something without knowing even somewhere else in the uk let alone Iran . if you tried to send anything there it would have been picked up on for sure .

If this was a genuine mistake then obviously i do feel sorry for the guy but i m not so sure it was .

His seem fairly rich so should n't have trouble finding any competent lawyers . His been fighting this for two years and his claims have been found to not hold up so do n't see the problem .

" A massive review of extradition led by a senior judge said critics misunderstand how the legal safeguards work .

The US courts system is a mess . No way he will get a fair trial , most likely he will be black mailed into a plea bargin and the other defendants will be black mailed into giving evidence against him . The man only made $ 500 from the FBI sting operation .
US Court system works on commission more prisoners more money .
