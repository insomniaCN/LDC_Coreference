Ex-White House Aide Charged in Corruption Case 
By PHILIP SHENON and ANNE E . KORNBLUT 
WASHINGTON , Sept . 19 - A senior White House budget official who resigned abruptly last week was arrested Monday on charges of lying to investigators and obstructing a federal inquiry involving Jack Abramoff , the Republican lobbyist who has been under scrutiny by the Justice Department for more than a year .

The arrest of the official , David H . Safavian , head of procurement policy at the Office of Management and Budget , was the first to result from the wide - ranging corruption investigation of Mr. Abramoff , once among the most powerful and best - paid lobbyists in Washington and a close friend of Representative Tom DeLay , the House majority leader .

According to court papers , Mr. Safavian , 38 , is accused of lying about assistance that he gave Mr. Abramoff in his earlier work at the General Services Administration , where he was chief of staff from 2002 to 2004 , and about an expensive golf trip he took with the lobbyist to Scotland in August 2002 .

Mr. Abramoff , a former lobbying partner of Mr. Safavian , was indicted last month in Florida on unrelated federal fraud charges . He is not identified by name in the court papers involving Mr. Safavian 's arrest . But " Lobbyist A " in an F . B . I . affidavit could only be Mr. Abramoff based on descriptive details in the documents filed in the Federal District Court here .

The Justice Department said Mr. Safavian had been specifically charged with making false statements to investigators about his efforts at the General Services Administration in 2002 to help Mr. Abramoff acquire two large pieces of government - owned property in the Washington area , including the historic Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue .

The department said Mr. Safavian had also lied to ethics officials at the agency , which manages federal property , when he sought approval to accept free transportation from Mr. Abramoff for the golf trip to Scotland that summer . According to court documents , Mr. Safavian told the ethics office that Mr. Abramoff had no business with the agency at the time , an assertion that was repeated in a separate interview this May with the Federal Bureau of Investigation .

Mr. DeLay , who has asked the House ethics committee to review his ties to Mr. Abramoff , has come under criticism from Congressional Democrats and ethics watchdog groups for taking a similar golf trip to Scotland with Mr. Abramoff in 2000 , including rounds of golf on the fabled course at St. Andrews .

The Justice Department made no accusation in its court papers of any tie between Mr. DeLay and Mr. Safavian nor of any involvement by Mr. DeLay in Mr. Abramoff 's effort to buy government property . A spokesman for Mr. Abramoff had no comment on the arrest of Mr. Safavian . Phone calls to Mr. Safavian 's home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington were not returned .

The White House said in a statement that Mr. Safavian had resigned on Friday and that " we , of course , will cooperate fully with the Justice Department in this investigation . " A spokesman said the White House would have no further comment on the arrest .

Mr. Safavian had recently been working on developing contracting policies for the multibillion - dollar relief effort after Hurricane Katrina .

The Justice Department did not reveal details of Mr. Safavian 's arrest , including where it occurred . The department also did not say why the criminal charges were brought directly by prosecutors , rather than by the Washington grand jury investigating Mr. Abramoff . The Justice Department often bypasses a grand jury when a criminal case is brought together hurriedly or when there is fear that a defendant may try to flee .

By itself , not much . But it might be the first signs of things unravelling in this Administration .

Remember , Watergate started out as a " third - rate burglary " .

It 's good to see that the people who are crooked are being caught before they can do much damage to the admin . If he does jail time then to bad , crooked is crooked . There are always some rotten apples in a barrel of good people .

What 's amazing is that anyone is charged with ANYTHING as long as the Bush Crime Family controls the Justice Department . Once the adults take over , the Bush thugs will be exposed as the most corrupt ever .
