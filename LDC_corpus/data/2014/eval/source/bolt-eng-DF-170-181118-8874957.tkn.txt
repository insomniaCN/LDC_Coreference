I 'm kind of in the middle of a debate . This thread might piss people off , but I 'm just telling a couple sides . My father and uncle both served in Vietnam , both are mid 60's in age , both retired , and both hardcore military till the end . I also know of 2 guys , both were only in the military for a short period . Here goes ... 

My uncle and father consider these guys " leeches " to the system . One was discharged after 2 or 3 years ( I think ) due to medical conditions he had growing up that did n't surface till later ( seizures ) . The other was injured in Kuwait , but he was in less than a year . They say these guys should n't receive the same benefits they do because the did n't go thru the same stuff they did . I think they are just pissed off grumpy old men .

My uncle saw combat for a short period , and has some good scars on his left arm / shoulder , and recieves $ 3000 a month and free medical care . He has n't has a job in 25 years . My father has a bum knee but only retired from security last year . They both act like every " civilian " in the world in a piece of shit . And they will tell you that to your face . At every family dinner in fact .

What do you think are the qualifications of lifetime benefits and pay after service ? 1 year ? 5 years ? 10 years ? 1 combat mission ? 5 ? 20 ?

Sounds like your relatives have issues still . Nam did things not just to the body . Things they saw . Things they witnessed . Their " homecoming " , which is a far cry from what our soldiers now receive . Perhaps your dad and uncle are still angry at the system and how it affected them .. and the people here who thought of them as " baby killers " . Not counting the actual combat they were in . Were you there ? No. 

I know many Nam vets that refuse to talk about their experiences . And probably for damn good reason , I m guessing .

Concerning your question about how long one must be in the service to get lifetime benefits . In my opinion , if they were sent to any hell hole , they should get benefits .

I know a leech or two . They suck off the system , but they never put their lives on the line . They just suck up the welfare check , have another kid or two , go to the food bank , steal sugar packets from table tops when they PAY for dinner , take ashtrays and towels from motel rooms and collect foodstamps every month . But they drive nice cars , go out to dinner often , and never are short of money when it comes to a new DVD that just came out or a playstation game .

They served and were injured ; we take care of them . That 's the way you maintain a military . You have to give them some incentive for risking death .

We owe it to our veterans to take care of their service - connected disabilities , especially if the disabilities were caused in combat .

I think there 's some confusion here . A retiree ( someone who serves 20 years or more in uniform ) earns a pension for the rest of his life . A veteran who has served less time but has a VA disability rating of 50 % or more will draw a monthly check based on the percentage of disability . Under 50 % there is no check ; the percentage is given as a tax credit .

Did your father and uncle retire from the military after 20 or more years ?

For me , if you emerge from basic as a serviceman , I owe you .

All of them served me .

I owe all of them .

And I proudly write that check .

The one thing I 've learned determining eligibility for DHS ... never take anyone 's word on income , lol . Not that people necessarily deliberately lie ; they just do n't know . The $ 3000 these guys take home , if it is $ 3000 , may represent money coming from a variety of different pots . There may be social security , SSD , a pension , AND VA disability .

I do n't care if you tripped down the steps at bootcamp and damaged your knee so bad you ca n't serve , you get the bennies .

Unless your freinds are totally messed up , they more than likely are not getting the same as retired Vets .

yes and they also go through " re-classifications " ....... : where in you are examined and a determination is made to see if your reward is still viable , in other words if they can vaporize ( or think they can ) or they think you are over your pain and suffering they will and your compensation right along with it .

they re-classified me right back to " health " ... <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

While some veterans do improve with time and treatment , I have no doubt others are re-classified downward to save money .

This is what government - run healthcare looks like .
