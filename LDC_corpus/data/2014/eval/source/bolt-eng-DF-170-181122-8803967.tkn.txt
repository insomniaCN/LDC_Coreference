Man says he has right to have sex with children 
Associated Press 
Last update : August 03 , 2006  6:16 AM 

CLEVELAND  A man accused of sexually assaulting nine boys with physical or mental disabilities told a judge that having sex with children is a sacred ritual protected by civil rights laws .

Phillip Distasio , who said he is the leader of a church called Arcadian Fields Ministries , represented himself at his pretrial hearing Wednesday . He is charged with 74 counts including rape , pandering obscenity to minors and corrupting another with drugs .

" I 'm a pedophile . I 've been a pedophile for 20 years , " he said in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Wednesday . " The only reason I 'm charged with rape is that no one believes a child can consent to sex . The role of my ministry is to get these cases out of the courtrooms . " 

Distasio said some of his congregants are among the victims in this case . Distacio , of Rocky River , is accused of molesting two disabled boys he tutored at his home and raping seven autistic boys at a Cleveland school for special - needs students where he was a teacher 's aide . All but one of the victims were under 13 .

A conviction on rape counts involving any of the eight younger boys would mean an automatic sentence of life in prison without parole eligibility , prosecutors said .

Distasio tried unsuccessfully in June to fire his court - appointed lawyer because he would n't pursue a religious freedom defense . Distasio could represent himself if the attorney remained as an adviser , Judge Kathleen Sutula said .

Rocky River is 9 miles west of Cleveland .

Ohio Man Claims Right To Have Sex With Boys 

Admitted Pedophile Says Children Can Consent 

POSTED : 6:52 am EDT August 3 , 2006 
CLEVELAND -- It was probably not a defense the court had heard before .
A suburban Cleveland man accused of sexually assaulting nine disabled boys told a judge Wednesday that his apartment was a religious sanctuary where smoking marijuana and having sex with children are sacred rituals protected by civil rights laws .
The admitted pedophile offered a surprising defense Wednesday to 74 charges of rape , drugs and pandering obscenity to minors .

Appearing in an Ohio court for a pretrial hearing , Phillip Distasio , 34 , of Rocky River , Ohio , said he was a pedophile .
He told the judge , " I 'm a pedophile . I 've been a pedophile for 20 years . The only reason I 'm charged with rape is that no one believes a child can consent to sex . The role of my ministry is to get these cases out of the courtrooms . " 
Distasio , a self - professed pagan friar , is representing himself on 74 charges . He said he 's the leader of a church called Arcadian Fields Ministries , and that some of his congregants are among the victims in his case .
The judge told Distasio to confine his arguments to secular laws at his trial , scheduled to begin Sept . 11 .
" If you want to challenge the law , that 's your right to do so , " Judge Kathleen Sutula said . " But we 're going to follow the laws of Ohio in this courtroom . " 
Cuyahoga County Bill Mason said Distasio was arrested after he wanted to write a blog for the Lakewood Library . Officials noticed something was wrong and notified Rocky River police .
Distasio was arrested on charges he molested two disabled boys he was tutoring at his home . He 's also accused of raping seven other autistic children at a Cleveland school for special - needs students , The Plain Dealer reported . All but one of the boys was under 13 , which carries a mandatory life - in - prison sentence if he is convicted , the paper reported .
Police said they found journals at Distasio 's apartment in which he described his illegal activities , along with child pornography and videotapes of him engaged in sex with boys , The Plain Dealer reported 
" Not all pedophilia is bad , and sex [ with boys ] can be healthy , " Distasio told the court .
According to the journals , two of Distasio 's victims were so helpless they could never tell anyone what happened .
" The defendant describes acts in which he had autistic children and he did what I would call sadistic sexual acts with these children , " said Mason .
The school he ran from his apartment was called Class Cutters . According to Distasio 's Web site , students and parents chose the curriculum in the school for unique children .
But prosecutors said it was little more than a trap that snared one victim and then another .
" Like all predators , he used this one child to bring other children to him and that 's what was happening , and that 's how he got his second victim , " said Mason .
And prosecutors believe there may be more victims .
Distasio has a history of working with children dating back 10 years .
Prosecutors said he could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted .

No. Liberalism is repsonsible for making pedophiles , transsexuals , people that have sex with animals , etc be seen as normal by us uneducated masses . They did nt cause these people to be freaks . They worked on changing the minds of the masses to make it seem like these people are nt freaks . I.E. ACLU .

The right to marry a 9 year old boy debate will be coming soon and the ACLU and the left will be leading the charge for his rights .

Really ? the ACLU are for paedophiles ? Got a link ? As for homosexuals , transexuals .... like hetros , if they are of age , who cares . it 's their life not yours . If they start pulling down churches , or demanding you do n't have sex with your wife , you might have a point . But unlike neocons , most homos I know are live and let live kinda people . IE , they do n't interfere with other 's lives ...

Absolutely , with all the voluminous factual information out there showing that queers are more apt to be pedophelic , queers still deny that there is a problem , in fact they never acknowledge a problem or at least the extent of a problem and anybody who dares point it out is labeled a bigot and a homophobe .

Ever hear of Nambla ? Hell they even champion pedophilia .

Maybe its because we are nt selfish enough to believe that what we do does nt effect others .

No one is an island . No one stands alone . Every act we choose effects the world around us . Either to act or react . And many of us understand the consequences of perverse behavior .

It takes a " special " mind to make a link between homosexuality and pedophilia . If this particular pedophile liked little girls , would you be blaming that on homosexuality too ? 

How about posting some facts and figures on how many homosexuals have actually been cured . Your whole argument is a farce ... you claim homosexuals can be cured , but think that pedophiles should be locked up forever ( I do too ) because they ca n't be .

Children are molested by pedophiles , not by homosexuals or heterosexuals .

Homosexuals try separating pedophiles from everything , as it suits their cause .

And yeah , a pedophile that attack little boys is a homosexual pedophile . Not real hard math .

True statement ! 

What some of us are trying to get some others to understand is this statement is not an indicator that homosexuality equals pedophilia or leads to pedophilia . In the same way that you and I do n't consider heterosexual pedophiles to be fellow heterosexuals , I imagine that homosexuals try to maintain a distinction between themselves and homosexual pedophiles . This seems reasonable to me .

So they have two problems instead of one . One does not negate the other .

To suggest that homosexual pedophilia is not a separate condition from homosexuality is pure speculation on your part . As opposed to speculation as you present yourself in another thread , I 'm surprised to see you embrace it here .
