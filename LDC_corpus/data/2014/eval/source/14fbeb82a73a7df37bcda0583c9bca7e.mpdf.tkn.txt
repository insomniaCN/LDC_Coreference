The " punishment " of Fayhan al Ghamdi for viciously beating , raping and burning his innocent 5 year old daughter who this sick and twisted man suspected of not being a virgin ... a fifty thousand dollar fine and time served ... is an offense to God and every decent human being alike .

It is also an extreme hypocrisy that in Saudi Arabia , a man can not be executed for killing his children or wife , but can face the death penalty for leaving Islam and becoming a Christian ( or a member of any other religion ) .

The World Muslim Congress came out with a statement decrying both the murder and the " punishment " ( if it can be called that ) . While I do not agree with them that the Quran is God 's word or that Muhammad is his prophet , everything else they said regarding the case is dead - on , in my opinion .

I agree with them that capital punishment is wrong , albeit not only for the reasons they gave ( which I think are good ones ) but also because God clearly said in the Bible that those who do not show mercy will not be shown mercy by God .

The Saudi rapist Fayhan al - Ghamdi , got away with murder 

The intention of Sharia law was to serve justice to the parties in conflict , it is human interpretation of God 's word to suit their era , it is not a divine law , neither is it God 's law as propagated . However , it is the abuse in administering the Sharia law that is the problem . Unfortunately , the Sharia law is so distorted that it sounds like a cruel system of law to a woman who gets thrown out on the whim of an idiot by calling Talaq three times , female rape victim , an apostate and the blasphemer .

Those men you have listed , " Imam Hanifa , Imam Shafi , Imam Hanbal , Imam Malik , Imam Ghazali or Imam Madoodi , " were great men with a few exceptions for their time .

They defined the Sharia in terms of the norms prevalent at that time . With all due respect and honor for their work , they did not have the same environment as Prophet Muhammad did or we have , - of working with different tribes and faiths , and as a result their attitudes were " stick it to them " .

This man , Fayhan al - Ghamdi got away paying the blood money . He should have been locked away , as they say in Urdu " Qaid ba - mushaqqat " prison with hard labor . What prevents the SOB from repeating it ? If he has the money to shell out again , he will do it again . I n the US there are many incidents where a hard core criminal was let out on bail , and he would do go out and do the same .

I am personally against the state killing the criminal deliberately , it denies the criminal from living the life , and prevents him from repenting his mistake .... and the blood money does not bring justice , compensation should be there to the victims , but that should be a part of whole punishment . We can not trade life for money .

Only God 's word is beyond question , Prophet 's words , if genuine , would be unquestionable . A lot has been dished out as Prophet 's word . I come across so much non-sense ascribed to him . He was the ultimate peace maker and rightfully called Rahmatul Aalameen - the mercy to mankind .

Muslims do not uphold that title for him ; they are brutal towards those who convert from Islam to other faiths , or blasphemers . Some Muslims are very insecure in their faith , they think that Prophet will disappear into thin air if someone criticizes him , or not defended . Prophet Muhammad ( pbuh ) is beyond defending . Some of the Imams did not have faith in the prophet and resorted to defending him , how wrong are they ! 

Be hopeful , things will change for better , the new generation will restore common sense to the religion which is about fairness , justness and respect for God 's creation . Islam is about freedom and not compulsion .
