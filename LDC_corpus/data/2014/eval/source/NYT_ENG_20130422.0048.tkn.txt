< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
ATHENS , Greece – In the most high - profile criminal trial of a politician in Greece for more than two decades , a former defense minister , Akis Tsochatzopoulos , appeared in a court here Monday charged with setting up a complex money laundering network to cover the trail of millions of euros in bribes .
< / P> 
<P> 
Tsochatzopoulos , 73 , a onetime socialist heavyweight , is on trial with his wife , daughter and 16 former aides and associates alleged to have participated in the scheme . He , his relatives and another five suspects have been in custody at Athens ’ high - security Korydallos Prison for the past year .

<P> 
The charges are highly unusual in a country where top - ranking state officials are rarely prosecuted .

<P> 
Tsochatzopoulos is accused of using a network of offshore companies during his stint as defense minister between 1996 and 2001 , and for several years after that , to siphon off millions of euros in bribes he is said to have taken in exchange for procurement contracts , including the purchase of a Russian missile defense system and German submarines .

According to prosecutors , Tsochatzopoulos received around 160 million euros , or about $ 210 million , in bribes for those two deals which were worth an estimated 3 billion euros . Authorities have traced 57 million euros .

The former minister , a founding member of the country ’s once dominant socialist party , Pasok , which is now part of a conservative - led coalition , has denied the charges . He is claiming his prosecution is politically motivated .

With public anger growing after the years of economic crisis , the government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras has vowed to crack down on corruption among the political elite whom most Greeks blame for the dysfunctional state system that created the country ’s huge debt problem and led it to dependence on foreign rescue loans .

In an unusually severe sentence in February , a court in Salonika , Greece ’s second - largest city , convicted the former mayor , Vassilis Papageorgopoulos , to life in prison for embezzling at least 18 million euros from city coffers .

In September , the Greek authorities began examining the bank accounts of more than 30 politicians to determine whether they should be charged with tax evasion and other crimes . Last month , three former ministers were charged with submitting false income declarations .

<P> 
Tsochatzopoulos is the most senior government official to stand trial since the former prime minister and Pasok founder , Andreas Papandreou , was acquitted in 1991 on charges of accepting bribes .
