You know like being a crab is wealth to you .

you just have more bitch inside you than most .

These rich people aquire a few things to say with each dollar they pocket .

Its what the founders intended .

Everyone gets a say .

The wealthy just get more words because ...... well ...... . hell ...... . they made more money ( or were given more money by someone ) 

Now people who have wealthy churches , or wealthy friends , or just get paid to be mommentarily wealthy to transfer these funds into campagin coffers have sooo much to say .

BP and its employees have given more than $ 3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years , with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . Donations come from a mix of employees and the company ’s political action committees — $ 2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP - related PACs and about $ 638,000 came from individuals .

Where did I say it did nt bother me ? 

Both you and I have likely never voted for someone who has not been influenced by this type of money .
