SEOUL , South Korea - The children of a former military dictator of South Korea , Chun Doo - hwan , said Tuesday that they would pay 167 billion won ( $ 154 million ) that their father owed the government in fines .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ We bow deeply in apology , ” Chun Jae - kook , Chun ’s eldest son , said in a family statement that he read Tuesday in front of the prosecutors ’ office in Seoul .
< / P> 
<P> 
Their decision closes a chapter on South Korea ’s prolonged struggle with the legacy of one of its most brutal former leaders .
< / P> 
<P> 
Chun , then an army major general , came to power in a coup in 1979 after the assassination of another military - backed strongman , President Park Chung - hee , the father of the current South Korean leader , President Park Geun - hye . Chun ruled until 1988 , when he was succeeded by Roh Tae - woo , his partner in the 1979 coup .

After South Korea ’s transition to democracy , both Chun and Roh were convicted of treason for their roles in the coup and a 1980 military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left hundreds dead . They were also convicted of collecting huge bribes from big business while in office .

<P> 
In 1997 , Chun was sentenced to life in prison and Roh to 17 years . Although they were later pardoned and freed , Chun and Roh had failed to pay the 220.5 billion won ( $ 203 million ) and 268.8 billion won ( $ 248 million ) that they were fined .
< / P> 
<P> 
Chun has so far paid only a quarter of his fine , claiming to have only 290,000 won ( $ 267 ) , in his bank accounts . But opposition lawmakers have said he might have huge assets stashed away .
< / P> 
<P> 
The statute of limitations on confiscating Chun ’s assets was to expire this year . But in June , the National Assembly passed a bill that extended it to 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they could prove that any of their properties originated from Chun ’s illegal funds .

<P> 
Prosecutors have since raided 90 facilities owned by the Chun family members , confiscating a total of 90 billion won ( $ 83 million ) worth of assets . Chun ’s brother - in - law was arrested on tax evasion charges earlier this month . Chun Jae - yong , one of the former leader ’s three sons , is also under investigation on similar charges .

<P> 
Chun Jae - kook said he and his two brothers and sister would give up buildings , land , paintings and other assets to help pay their father ’s fine . He said the house where Chun and his wife live would also be sold to help pay the fine , although he asked government officials to let his parents live there until they die . Chun is 82 .

<P> 
Lee Jin - han , a senior prosecutor , told reporters that the assets prosecutors have secured so far from Chun ’s family members , including those they said on Tuesday they would give up , amounted to 170 billion won ( $ 156 million ) , enough to cover Chun ’s unpaid fine .

<P> 
Roh paid off his fine this month . His brother and a businessman whose daughter divorced Roh ’s son helped him pay the 23 billion won ( $ 21 million ) he still owed .
