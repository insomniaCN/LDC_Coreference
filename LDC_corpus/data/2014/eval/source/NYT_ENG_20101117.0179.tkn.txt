U.S. JURY ACQUITS FORMER GUANTANAMO DETAINEE OF MOST CHARGES 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
The first former Guantanamo detainee to be tried in a civilian 
court was acquitted Wednesday of all but one of more than 280 
charges of conspiracy and murder in the 1998 terrorist bombings of 
the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi , Kenya , and Dar es Salaam , Tanzania .
< / P> 
<P> 
The case has been seen as a test of President Barack Obama 's 
goal of trying detainees in federal court whenever feasible , and 
the result may again fuel debate over whether civilian courts are 
appropriate for trying terrorists .
< / P> 
<P> 
The defendant , Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani , 36 , was convicted of one 
count of conspiracy to destroy government buildings and property .
He was acquitted of four counts of conspiracy , including conspiring 
to kill Americans and to use weapons of mass destruction .
< / P> 
<P> 
Because of the unusual circumstances of Ghailani 's case -- after 
he was captured in Pakistan in 2004 , he was held for nearly five 
years in a so - called black site run by the CIA and at Guantanamo 
Bay , Cuba -- the prosecution faced significant legal hurdles even 
getting his case to trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
On the eve of trial last month , the government lost a key ruling 
that may have seriously damaged its chances of winning convictions .
< / P> 
<P> 
In the ruling , the judge , Lewis A . Kaplan of U.S. District Court 
in Manhattan , barred it from using an important witness against 
Ghailani because the government had learned about the man through 
Ghailani 's interrogation while he was in CIA custody , where his 
lawyers say he was tortured .
< / P> 
<P> 
The witness , Hussein Abebe , would have testified that he had 
sold Ghailani the large quantities of TNT used to blow up the 
embassy in Dar es Salaam , prosecutors told the judge , calling him 
" a giant witness for the government . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
On Wednesday , when the judge 's clerk asked how the jury found on 
counts 11 to 223 , which were all counts of murder , the jury foreman 
replied , " Not guilty . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Ghailani , who remains in custody , faces a sentence of 20 years 
to life in prison . The unexpected verdict by the anonymous six - man , 
six - woman jury came in the fifth day of deliberations .
< / P> 
<P> 
Ghailani 's lawyers -- Peter E . Quijano , Steve Zissou and Michael 
K . Bachrach -- had argued that their client was innocent and had 
been duped into assisting in the terrorist conspiracy .
< / P> 
<P> 
" This verdict is a reaffirmation that this nation 's judicial 
system is the greatest ever devised , " Quijano said . " It is truly 
a system of laws and not men , where , in the shadow of the World 
Trade Center , this jury acquitted Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani of 284 out 
of 285 counts . "
