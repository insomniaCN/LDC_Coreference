Today , I agreed to help two friends , K and A , make wedding invitations for their niece . Waste of my Saturday .... blah .... let me tell you why ! 
# 1 : The bride is the most immature 20 year old I have EVER met . For reelz . She quit her job at a large retail store because she got in trouble . She said , " I do n't need that crap ! " Now she working at some place where she works 12 hours a week and complains that they do n't have money ..... 
# 2 : The bride told my friend , K , that they would need about 200 invites . This was about 2 months ago . So K cut most of the pieces to be ready for today . She comes today and says , " My mom said we only need 60 invites " . Umm ..... really ? ! ? ! And the kicker is : They do n't even have a freakin ' guest list to really know the numbers . We made 100 invites .
# 3 : They are getting married in 4 months : They have no cake , no photographer , no menu , and no church set up .
# 4 : And the best one : They plan to get pg right away , so she / they can get back on assistance . Awesome .... 
The best part of the day was 2:00 , when everyone left and it was me , K and A . Thank goodness for small miracles .
Thanks for listening to me vent !!

I hate when you spend time helping people and walk away thinking " now there was six hours of my life I 'll never get back . " The bride sounds like a real gem ... and a bright one at that !

Speaking of her being bright ..... 
Someone had a bottle of water and she had put in a slice of lemon . The bride said " How in the world did you get that lemon in there ? Did you cut the lemon ? I mean the hole of the bottle is so small and that lemon is huge ! "

Wow , I think I would have been livid at that point . Someone needs to tell that girl to grow the F up , and perhaps give her a throat punch .
I do n't know how many times I wanted to quit my retail job , but knew the cash was more important than my pride . Grrr ....

This post made me so angry . I hate ungrateful people . I would have told her to do the invites herself . I probably also would have punched her if I found out about her trying to get PG right away .
