I read some interesting stuff about how big oil intended to kill jfk because he was getting rid of the oil depletion allowance .

Not content with blackmiling him with sex scandals or knowledge of Addison 's , Big oil apparently decided to off him .

What was it really ?

Lee Harvey Oswald shot him from a window of the Texas Schoolbook Depository building .

If powerful constituencies resorted to assassination whenever a president advocated a policy they disagreed with , I doubt any presidential candidate would survive the primaries .

Evidence , please . Specific details , not hearsay and supposition . What were the names of these Texans ? What were the dates of their meetings ? What were the details of their plan ? How did you get this evidence ? How reliable is your source ?

I read just the first paragraph and it 's already filled with fallacies .

Especially this one : " Those who benefited most from JFKs murder are most certainly guilty of it . " 

Well , no.

The argument is that some people who are known not to have done something may nevertheless have had a motive for doing it , so if it were n't for the fact that they did n't do it then it might have been understandable if they had .

To which I address the response : Who cares ? 

There is no need to debunk the argument from motive , as it 's a non-argument in the first place .

No , you could n't . First the police would have to find evidence that you had opportunity AND prove with other evidence that you did it . And , it is not necessarily the one who inherits the most . More likely the one who is in the most desperate need of the inheritance . That 's why the police do n't get to just arrest the most likely suspect , they must provide evidence .

Tin foil killed JFK . Yes , Reynolds , or whatever company , just knew the assassination would make people paranoid , which even back then drove them to wear tinfoil hats . I know this because it came to me in a dream after eating too much kimchee one afternoon . <img src= " http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/emot-tinfoil.gif"/> :

The whole " XXX hated JFK and had motive to do it so therefore they are suspect " is long past it 's time .

Some JFK researcher somewhere could report tomorrow that they have an audio recording of someone in the mafia claiming they wanted to kill JFK and his brother , even speculating on ways to do it , and it still would n't implicate them in a conspiracy , unless you can find a legitimate way to connect them with Lee Harvey Oswald .

This much is established : JFK was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald , who was in the window on the 6th floor of the School Book Depository Building . He was the only shooter . These are the facts .

As of now , despite desperate attempts , there is no indication that he was working with or on behalf of any but himself . Any attempts to claim otherwise will require actual evidence that there was a connection and not just the implication that something " could be there . "

Just because of the oil depletion allowance ? Are they sure he was n't going to have the government release the plans for the 300 mpg carburetor ?
