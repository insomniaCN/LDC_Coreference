Colson authored the 1971 memo listing Nixon 's major political opponents , later known as Nixon 's Enemies List . A quip that " Colson would walk over his own grandmother if necessary " mutated into claims in news stories that Colson had boasted that he would run over his own grandmother to re-elect Nixon . In a February 13 , 1973 conversation , Colson told Nixon that he had always had a little prejudice .  Plotz reports that Colson sought to hire Teamsters thugs to beat up anti-war demonstrators . Colson also proposed firebombing the Brookings Institution and stealing politically damaging documents while firefighters put the fire out .

Colson 's voice , from archives from April 1969 , was heard in the 2004 movie Going Upriver deprecating the anti-war efforts of John Kerry . Colson 's orders were to " destroy the young demagogue before he becomes another Ralph Nader . " In a phone conversation with Nixon on April 28 , 1971 , Colson said , " This fellow Kerry that they had on last week ... He turns out to be really quite a phony . " 

Watergate and Ellsberg scandals 

Colson also became involved in the Committee to Re-elect the President ( CRP or CREEP ) . At a CRP meeting on March 21 , 1971 , it was agreed to spend $ 250,000 on " intelligence gathering " on the Democratic Party . Colson and John Ehrlichman appointed E . Howard Hunt to the White House Special Operations Unit ( the so - called " Plumbers " ) which had been organized to stop leaks in the Nixon administration . Hunt headed up the Plumbers' burglary of Pentagon Papers - leaker Daniel Ellsberg 's psychiatrist 's office in September 1971 . The Pentagon Papers were military documents about the Vietnam War which helped increase opposition to the war . Colson hoped that revelations about Ellsberg could be used to discredit the anti-Vietnam War cause .

2 . Everybody should read this before the liberal media whitewashes this asshole 's past I tried real hard to remember that Colson was a human being and he had friends and relatives who cared about him and would feel sorrow that he croaked .

But you know what ? None of his friends / relatives did anything to stop him from being a miserable piece of shit . So fuck him and fuck them too . I 'm non " happy " he 's taking a dirt nap , but I 'm not unhappy either .

He is responsible for all the Roves , Atwaters , and even the Breitbarts who came after him .
