'Terminally ill ' Lockerbie bomber living the good life in Libya

It has now been six months since we were outraged over the release of Abdel Basset al - Megrahi and the intrigue surrounding the decision to grant him his ( relative ) freedom . Megrahi is better known as The Lockerbie Bomber .  The UK Telegraph now reports .
Megrahi , is now living in a spacious two - story villa with his wife and their five grown - up children in a prosperous suburb of Tripoli , the Libyan capital .

The property has a spacious garden and an area where the family erects a large tent to entertain visitors for celebrations .

The Megrahis , who are part of a prominent tribe , are well off and it is understood that his family was paid substantial compensation by the Libyan Government after he was jailed for life .
When Megrahi was granted his release on August 20th of last year it was on humanitarian terms as he was terminally ill and expected to die within three months .

President Obama was outraged by the decision of the Scottish government to release the Lockerbie bomber and loudly condemned the action . Kenny MacAskill , the Scottish Justice Secretary was lionized by the media and singled out for blame although according to CNN .
He had talked to families of British and U.S. victims , U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton , U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder , British authorities , Libyan officials , and al Megrahi himself , declassified Scottish government records show .

... media reports that the Scottish government may have released Abdel Basset al Megrahi after serving eight years of his 27 - year sentence because of a desire to improve commercial ties between Britain and Libya .

Specifically , the committee should explore : Whether commercial interests played a role in the decision to release Mr. Megrahi ,  Lautenberg wrote .
Six months have passed and there has been no Senate hearing . The only action taken by the Senate was to unanimously condemn the release in a remarkable show of bi-partisanship . There has been no further inquiry into the complicity of Hilary Clinton , Eric Holder or President Obama in this matter and Megrahi continues to live in luxury , although he is still said to be gravely ill . The 270 persons ( including 189 Americans ) who died by Megrahis hand should not be so easily forgotten .

Well for starters there 's more than a little doubt that Megrahi was responsible for the bombing , and secondly what right does the U.S. Senate have to say anything over this matter ? The U.S. Senate has no right to get involved in the internal affairs of the UK or Scotland .

Kevin ; because so many Americans died in the Lockerbie bombing , the citizens of this Country have every right to ask the Senate to get involved especially since the country responsible for seeing this bomber got his just do , failed to do just that . Furthermore , since it appears this bomber is living the high life since his release , I believe the case is in our hands now . Personally , I 'm hoping Mossad gets involved , since they 're familiar with the area .

< / quote> 

Americans DO have the right of self - defence and the right to get involved in the internal affairs of the UK if what the UK is doing is killing Americans , as it is .

International law allows self - defence against outlaw regimes , royalist or fascist states which have no protection under the United Nations Charter law which affords certain protections only to nation states - protection for states which serve the nations and are accountable to the nations , but no protection at all to states oppressing the nations like say Saddam Hussein 's Iraqi state , or , the King of Saudi Arabia 's state - funding and controlling their secret agents Al Qaeda - or I would argue , if push comes to shove , Queen Elizabeth 's United Kingdom state , all of which are far from democratic countries where the state serves the nation .

None of these states - Saddam 's Iraq , the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or the United Kingdom had or have democratic elections for the post of head of state , so none of them are true nation states .

Now Scotland is a devolved part of the UK state which Queen Elizabeth is head of and her family 's paws are all over this oil for release deal as I explained in an earlier post .

<quote orig_author= " Peter Dow " > 
How the UK employed Prince Andrew , the Duke of York to set up Libyan oil deals for compassionate release of the Lockerbie bomber Megrahi .

Prince Andrew , the Duke of York is the second son and third child of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh . As well as carrying out various royal duties , he currently serves as the United Kingdom 's Special Representative for International Trade and Investment reporting to Peter Mandelson who is the UK 's current First Secretary of State , Secretary of State for Business , Innovation and Skills , President of the Board of Trade and Lord President of the Council . In that capacity he has visited Libya and met with Gaddafi several times to set up oil deals .

In 2007 , Prince Andrew was appointed by his mother , the Queen , as the Lord High Commissioner of the Church of Scotland in 2007 , a post previously held by David Steel , the first Presiding Officer of the re-convened Scottish Parliament and a post now held by George Reid , the 2nd former Presiding Officer of the new Scottish Parliament .

By use of such patronage , the UK royal family is able to form close links with influential persons in Scottish politics and with the Scottish churches .

Therefore Prince Andrew has all the connections anyone would ever need to set up a Libyan oil deals for Scottish justice " compassionate release " for the Lockerbie bomber .

Indeed , Colonel Gaddafi has publicly thanked Prince Andrew for arranging the release of Megrahi .

So Peter Mandelson may claim to know nothing of any such deal <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/> but he certainly appointed the right person , Prince Andrew , to set such a deal up and it looks like that is exactly what has happened .

Therefore whereas it may well be the case that Kenny MacAskill has not personally profited from Libyan oil deal money , it is entirely possible that some back channel deal involving third party donations to one or more of the Church of Scotland 's worthy causes has bought pro-compassionate - release spiritual advice from the Church of Scotland clerics to Kenny MacAskill and it may be it is those who interpret MacAskill 's Christian faith for him who were the ones who have convinced him that compassionate release was the thing to do in Megrahi 's case .

Certainly , the church is always short of money and certainly that is how Arab monarchs and dictators often operate in their own countries - by funding Islamic programmes and sometimes even getting the Islamic clerics to put out pro-jehadi messages when they wish to incite terrorist wars by proxy fought by the likes of Al Qaeda but in a plausibly deniable way which is not easily identified directly as being ordered by the monarch or dictator concerned .

So supporting terrorism in this modest way has begun in European Christian churches as bought by Arab or African oil money . What is next ? 

Are we going to see Libyan or other oil money funding Christian crusader suicide bombers , bought and paid for by oil deal money ? 

It happened in the Arab world and it could happen here . The release of this terrorist is just the start unless we get wise to what this oil money in the wrong hands is buying - a terrorist war against our values of freedom and democracy and in favour of monarchy and dictatorship .

< / quote> 

Also let us not forget that the USA has long been supportive of the UK monarchy - President Bush inviting Prince Charles the heir apparent and Queen Elizabeth to the White House , American government representatives attending international meetings in London and elsewhere where the Queen presides , the US President shaking hands with the Queen etc. - all actions which have helped the UK monarchists in the struggle for legitimacy against British republicans who want our own revolution against the UK monarchy same as the Americans and Irish republics had .

So come to terms with the fact that the US government has long been getting involved in the internal affairs of Britain , to prop up the UK , against the true long term interests of republican USA . See the thanks and the stabs in the back you get from the Queen for trusting the UK monarchy ? 

All Americans need to do is to reverse course and start backing your true friends in Britain - those like me who want to see the back of a rotten corrupt monarchy which puts its own interests before those of the people - of every country .

If you meant Prince Andrew THEN we 'd be talking about an easy win in the War on Terror .

So long as Americans are soft in the head about the UK monarchy then Americans are going to be soft in the head about the Saudi monarchy and the other Arab monarchs and dictators who are funding Al Qaeda , broadcasting pro-Jihadi clerics on Arab - TV and generally stabbing us in the back with what they buy from us with the money they get from the oil we let them control .

Every King , Queen , Prince and Princess should have an " accident " and only democratically elected heads of states should be allowed . We should fix the world so that vast oil wealth is only in the hands of responsible elected leaders who will spend it on useful things like services for the people instead of a global war to impose their rule upon us .

Wise up America . Neither Prince Andrew nor any of the UK royals are your loyal friends .

America 's true friends are British republicans .
