Google reached a class action settlement in October last year with the Authors 
Guild and the Association of American Publishers to a copyright infringement 
suit they filed against the Internet powerhouse in 2005 .

Under the settlement , Google agreed to pay 125 million dollars to resolve 
outstanding claims and establish an independent " Book Rights Registry , " which 
will provide revenue from sales and advertising to authors and publishers who 
agree to digitise their books .

international treaties on authors ' rights .
