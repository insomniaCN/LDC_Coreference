Zimmerman became a national figure after he shot and killed an unarmed Martin , 17 , while working as a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford , Fla . , in February 2012 . Martin ’s death prompted a nationwide outcry against Florida ’s self - defense laws , and Zimmerman was ultimately charged with second - degree murder .
