In yet another indication of the involvement of Pakistani establishment in the 26 / 11 Mumbai attack , LeT operative David Headley has corroborated the statement of lone captured terrorist Ajmal Amir Kasab that the terrorists got training from Pakistan Navy .

During his interrogation , Kasab confessed that the ten terrorists , including himself , who attacked Mumbai received training of swimming and underwater diving from the Pakistan Navy 's frogmen .

A frogman is someone who is trained to dive , swim and combat .

" The role of frogmen was confirmed by Headley when the Indian investigators interrogated him in the US last month , " an official said .

This is being seen as another clear indicator of the Pakistani establishment 's involvement in the planning and execution of the Mumbai terror attack , which claimed 168 lives .

Home secretary Gopal K Pillai had recently said that the ISI was " literally controlling and coordinating the ( Mumbai ) attack from beginning to end " .

Pakistani - American Headley , currently in American custody , was interrogated by a team of National Investigation Agency .

Officials said that the Indian investigators so far have no plan to interrogate Headley 's accomplice Tahawwur Hussain Rana , a Pakistani origin Canadian citizen , as his involvement in the Mumbai attack conspiracy was limited to providing finance .

" If necessary we may interrogate Rana also , though we have no immediate plan to do so , " an official said .

Headley has also told his interrogators that the Pakistani intelligence agency had paid Rs 25 lakh to LeT to purchase a boat which terrorists used to travel from Karachi to the Pakistani maritime boundary , where they hijacked an Indian fishing boat 'Kuber' to reach Mumbai .

Headley also identified through voice sample test two ISI officers believed to be constant contact with the terrorists who carried out the 60 - hour attack in Mumbai on November 26 , 2008 .

Officials said Indian investigators have information that ISI chief Lieutenant General Ahmed Shuja Pasha had met one of the handlers of the Mumbai attack , Sajjid Mir , who is currently in a Pakistani jail .

" All this information have been shared by India with Pakistan through the multiple dossiers given to it , " the official said .
