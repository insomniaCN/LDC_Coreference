I 've never been this irked before , but her effing weirdness has gotten to my limit , 

I usually pass off her stupidity on that fact that she 's extremely narrow minded and has lived a sheltered life . Does n't know any better when it comes to social situations sometimes .
She says to me the other day ... " So and So and i were talking the other day and we 've never seen anyone with as bad pregnant brain as you have this time around . " 
Me : " why ? What did I do ? " 
MIL : ignores question and just repeats the original comment about me having horrible pregnant brain , but with no examples .
This was me when it happened : <img src= " http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-7.gif" alt= " Tongue Tied " / > <img src= " http : / / community . thenest . com / cs / emoticons / emotion - 10 . gif " alt= " Embarrassed " / > 
This was me about an hour later thinking about it : <img src= " http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-42.gif" alt= " Confused " / > <img src= " http : / / community . thenest . com / cs / emoticons / emotion - 43 . gif " alt= " Confused " / >

hahaha 
do n't be so sensitive . the good thing about pg brain is you can forget all the nasty *** too . so totally forget to pick up your kids from her house for 2 - 3 hours on a sunday when you need a mani - pedi ? 
what ? you have them ? I thought they were in their rooms ?

My MIL would do this , except ' so and so ' would be one of her imaginary friends , who also think she 's fabulous and do n't understand why we all do n't appreciate her more .

Ha , thia reminded me of mil when we were planning our wedding . They were moving into their new condo a few weeks before our shower . Everytime someone would mention our wedding , she would go on and on about the housewarming party that her friends were throwing for her . She wanted to go with us when we registerer . I thought it was strange but let her come . I had already set our registry up online so we got our gun and started zapping . She showed up a few minutes later with her own gun . She wanted to see eveything on our list so we did n't register for the same items . There was never a housewarming party .

Your mil is a ninny .
If she says it again , be sure to say " well I 'm not so foggy that I do n't remember the last time you insulted me like this . Thanks for nothing " .
Or " So you 've said before . " Frigid smile , walk off .
Or " you bittch " . Finger given , door slammed in her face .
I suppose it all depends on the context of the situation . I 'd pick one of these .
