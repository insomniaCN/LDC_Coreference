Hundreds of people protested on Monday against the Palestinian Authority 's 
support for delaying the endorsement of a UN report on possible war crimes 
committed during Israel 's Gaza offensive .
< / P> 
<P> 
The demonstration was held as anger mounted over the UN Human Rights Council 's 
decision to delay consideration of the report compiled by former international 
war crimes prosecutor Richard Goldstone .
< / P> 
<P> 
In the West Bank political capital of Ramallah , hundreds of people protested 
against the decision , waving placards saying the delay " insults the blood of the 
martyrs and wounds our people , " an AFP correspondent said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Another sign read " Delaying the vote on the Goldstone report frees the hand of 
( Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin ) Netanyahu in Jerusalem , " referring to clashes 
earlier this week between police and Muslim protesters in the Old City .
< / P> 
<P> 
The adoption of the report by the 49 - member council was seen as a key step 
towards eventually bringing war crimes charges against Israeli leaders and 
Palestinian militants at the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) .
< / P> 
<P> 
Israel had warned that endorsing the report could endanger US - backed efforts to 
relaunch the peace process , and Washington was believed to have exerted strong 
pressure on the Palestinians to drop their support for the vote .
< / P> 
<P> 
In Jerusalem pro-Palestinian activists protested against the decision at a news 
conference in front of two homes that were occupied by Israeli settlers over the 
summer .
< / P> 
<P> 
" ( The decision ) was a knife in the backs and in the hearts of all the martyrs , " 
said Jamal al - Jumaa from the Popular Campaign to End the Wall , an organisation 
that opposes Israel 's controversial separation fence .
< / P> 
<P> 
Muhammad Jadallah , the head of the Coalition for Jerusalem , demanded an apology 
from Western - backed Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We want president Abbas to apologise for what happened , and if the government 
had anything to do with the decision we want it to resign , " he said .
< / P> 
<P> 
The UN report accused both Israel and Palestinian armed groups of committing war 
crimes during the three - week war in Gaza that erupted on December 27 , killing 
some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis .
