<quote> 
Lawyers and media pundits in Nigeria are accusing the government of acting illegally by agreeing to settle criminal bribery charges against Dick Cheney out of court .

Nigeria charged Cheney and applied for an Interpol arrest warrant earlier this month in connection with a $ 180 - million bribery case . Cheney 's former employer , Halliburton , reportedly agreed to pay $ 35 million to see the charges dropped .

Moral of the story ? If you 're rich enough , you ' can pay your way out of a jail cell with ease . The corrupt , avaricious , chickenhawk bastard is going to get off scot - free .

Does any rational American ( with the exception of hate - filled anti-American radical lefties ) think Nigeria 's indictment of the former Vice President of the United States should be taken seriously ? Do n't make me laugh .

You mean the Interpol clusterfuck that originally issued the warrant for Cheney now has to issue a warrant for the government of Nigeria ? 

Suh - weet !

Nigerian officials say they made the deal because they were n't certain they could get a guilty verdict against Cheney .
