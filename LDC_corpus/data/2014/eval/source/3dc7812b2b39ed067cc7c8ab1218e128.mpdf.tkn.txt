Hi Everyone <img src= " http://static.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/> 

Ill explain my story ; 

I was a Gamesmaker for the London 2012 games , and basically as a " Games Graduate " i went for a interview on Monday at a Jobcentre In London , Now i have a previous conviction which i was not convicted of , i was mistaken for someone but i was found guilty for 7 months until it was appealed at the high court ; now they made me do a CRB check but will this come up on a Government CRB ? or do you think it might be just a basic one ? seeing as i had to be CRB for the Olympics and they did n't say anything

I believe it would come up on a CRB enhanced check but that you would have nothing to worry about as the case was overturned . As an ex-employer I had to have CRB checks done for all my staff and many had convictions , it is up to the discretion of the employer how serious the convictions are to them and their business - I ca n't see from what you have said how this ' conviction ' would be held against you .

Long as you was n't acquited due to a technicality and it 's just you who 's claiming to be mistaken for someone else , then it 's all good . It 'll show on enhanced CRB checks . Not sure about basic CRB checks .

The Crime that i was found Guilty for , was Benefit Fraud so that 's why i m a bit worried working in a Jobcentre , but then it was someone who uses these forum 's who set me up on my previous account , who managed to use all my Identity and then i got convicted but overturned by a high judge

No It will not . LOCOG and the ODA used Disclosure Scotland for their checks
