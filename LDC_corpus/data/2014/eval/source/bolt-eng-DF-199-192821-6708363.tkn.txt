Lawyer to Sue Jews for Biblical 'Plunder' 
By Opheera McDoom - 9/11/03 

CAIRO ( Reuters ) - An Egyptian lawyer said Wednesday he was planning to sue the world 's Jews for " plundering " gold during the Exodus from Pharaonic Egypt thousands of years ago , based on information in the Bible .

Nabil Hilmi , dean of the law faculty at Egypt 's al - Zaqaziq University , said the legal basis for the case was under study by a group of lawyers in Egypt and Europe .

" This is serious , and should not be misread as being political against any race . We are just investigating if a debt is owed , " Hilmi told Reuters in a telephone interview .

The relevant passage from the Bible , Exodus 12 verses 35 to 36 reads : " The Israelites had done as Moses told them ; they had asked the Egyptians for jewelry of silver and gold , and for clothing .... And so they plundered the Egyptians . " This translation is in the New Revised Standard Version of the Bible .

Some Jewish commentators say that while the Biblical passage may be fact , the Hebrews were enslaved by the Egyptians and therefore had a right to claim compensation for wages .

" Hilmi 's assertion that the Hebrew Bible is fact has given Israel and Jews the world over a reason to rejoice . He has opened the door for all Jews to sue Egypt for over 400 years of slavery , " writer Beth Goodman told Reuters .

Tareq Zaghoul , a lawyer at the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights in Cairo , said it would be difficult to prove historical fact in the passage that would stand up in court .

" This needs historical documents and evidence to back it up . It is rather far - fetched , " he said .

Hilmi said Egyptian and European historical and religious experts were trying to establish if the biblical passage could be taken as fact , and hence form the basis for a lawsuit .

He said the argument that Jews could sue Egypt for enslaving them was also being studied by experts .

Hilmi gave no details of which court he planned to file the case in or whether he thought such a case would be exempt from the sort of statute of limitations that in many countries rules out legal cases after a certain period of time .

He also declined to put a value on the goods " plundered . "

he will lose . If we all sued on our beliefs I think we would all make outselves believe we were owed something .

I do n't suppose the Jews will counter sue ? False imprisonment and denial of civil rights , or something sounds right .

The whole throwing the babies into the Nile was also something that the Jews might not have appreciated about their treatment at the hands of the Egyptians .

Ah , my brother sent this to me . Actually , we get out ( at least we American Jews do ) on double jeopardy ( 5th Amendment , US Constitution ) - this kind of case was adjudicated by , of all people , Alexander the Great . We wuz sued for the land , and we countersued for payment for services rendered for 400 years ( or however long it was ) in Egypt .

Oh dear ! So - do the Egyptians get compensation for the dead firstborn sons ( or was it just children ) ? 

The locusts oughta be worth something .

One assumes slavery was legal at the time , so the Jews might have trouble with that one .

Er - we gon na sue the snakes , for the fall ? 

Why not just sue all the gods and all the churches - for , well , EVERYTHING ! To have life is to suffer , nuh ? Oy veh ! 

The Alexander the Great thing is great ! - any sources ?

Jespah -- No offense meant , rather just a commentary on how lawsuit - happy our soceity has become .

I feel like I could be sued at any time for any ridiculous reason , merely for harassment , threat , or manipulation .

What is your opinion : Do we need fewer / same / more lawsuits these days ? 
More of one kind , less of another ?

Hmm , lem me see if I can find the stuff on Alex . I think it was just an email , which always smells like an urban legend to me .

CB - no offense taken . I do n't know about more or fewer lawsuits , but is n't it better for people to resolve their differences in court rather than with pistols at 10 paces ? Some lawsuits are good . Seat belts would n't have to be in cars if it was n't for plaintiffs ' tort lawyers , for example .

Well , yes , but do n't pistols induce a certain quality of civility in our everyday lives ?
