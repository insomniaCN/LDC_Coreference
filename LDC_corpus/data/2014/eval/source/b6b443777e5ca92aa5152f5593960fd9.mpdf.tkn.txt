My friend was scammed this christmas and I would nt want anyone else to fall prey to these bar * *** * s 

He answered one of those russian wife emails which are going around at the moment .
When she replied she seemed nice and the photo given was a gorgous young lady . Ater a few exchanges of emails my friend decided he wanted to meet however there was a catch . She had no money for the flight . It would cost £450 + £50 transfer by western union . Anyway blinded by love or lust he sent the money . Unfortunately that was not the last he heard from her because she said she will come over christmas . My friend embarked on a shopping spree . Pressies and doing up the bedroom to make it their love nest .
He then got an email saying she needed to prove to immigration that she could support herself . She needed $ 1500 or £900 . He was dubious but checked with a someone eastern european he was acquainted with , who convinced him it was possible . Anyway he promptly wired the money over to her .
The day before she was supposed to arrive she got an email . It said she was on the train after visiting the bank when she was mugged . She needed more money . By this time my friend was desperate to meet her . Without a thought he paid her .

I think you can guess what happened . Did she show up for Christmas ? ? 

My friend is one of the nicest guys you can meet . He has been unlucky in love and has 2 small children . Although sex was probably at the front of his mind I think he genuinely was looking for a companion .
He has learnt a valuable less extremely expensively

Too late now , but another variant on advance fee fraud ( google for this and / or 419 scam ) . Most of them hit one or more of the 7 deadly sins , and there are that many photo 's and documents available on t'web these days .

He 's far from being the only one by the way - these scams rake in several BILLION each year .

This is the classic foreighn bride scam - your friend was probably not even communicating with a women at all . Golden Rule is never to send money topeople you do n't know and have never met .

i m sorry but i have no sympathy at all for him . surely he has read and heard these stories before .
how many times did he send money ? ?? id have understood a tad if only once but 3 times , come on , get a grip .

These scams happen because people are stupid enough to belive them .

do nt tell me when you first read the post you first thought was nt " he has nt really fallen for that " 

tut tut tut , maybe next time he will learn when he gets an email saying he 's won the spanish lottery , all he needs to do is send 1000 to release the money !!!! LOL

There is no way a Russian women can get a VISA to visit the UK on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a UK sponsor , and the VISA would be a fiancee VISA , not a tourist VISA .

You need to check that . It actually depends on the status of the lady in her own country , but yes she would still need a sponsor . MY sons girlfriend is Thai , she qualifies in her own right for a tourist visa and does n't need a fianc ! visa . Fianc ! visa means you have to marry in 60 or 90 days a tourist visa gives you 6 - 12 months in the UK This scam used to be the the Thai lady British passport scam .

Is anyone else always suspicious of posts which involve much foolishness supposedly happening to ' a friend ' .

Do n't get me wrong - I do feel sorry for the person it happened to - if only for the obvious loneliness which drove a man to the point where all reason flies out of the window but was n't it a wise woman ( or man ) who said that God gave Man a brain and a p * * * s but not enough blood to run both of them at the same time !!!! 

Sorry could n't resist that - I 'll understand if it gets moderated .

Edited for typo .
