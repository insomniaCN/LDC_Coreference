The Taiwan High Court held a hearing Friday on whether to further extend the 
detention of former President Chen Shui - bian , who has been held since Dec . 30 , 
2008 in connection with corruption and money laundering charges .

Presiding judge Teng Chen - chiu said that the court would hand down a ruling on 
whether Chen will remain detained for two more months before the current 
extension expires on Oct . 18 . The former president 's detainment was previously 
extended for three months in July .

Chen said at the court hearing that he has been detained for 674 days and that 
he has said " all he has to say . " One should not assume that he has access to 
channels of fleeing the country because he has been president , he added .

Chen pointed out that Teng had said that if he remitted all the money his family 
held overseas back to Taiwan , he would have a good chance of being released .

The former president said that he had remitted all US$ 18.43 million back . The 
amount fell short of the US$ 21 million the prosecution alleged his family had 
laundered to Swiss banks because of losses including processing fees and charges 
for the early termination of investment contracts .

" If the judge still wo n't release me on bail now that I 've returned the money , 
is he cheating me ? " the former president asked .

After the hearing , Chen returned to the Taipei Detention Center .

He and his wife Wu Shu - jen were found guilty of corruption , forgery and money - 
laundering in September 2009 and given life sentences , but the Taiwan High Court 
reduced the sentences to 20 years on June 11 .

Chen , his wife and the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme 
Prosecutors Office , which led the probe into the ex-president 's cases , all
