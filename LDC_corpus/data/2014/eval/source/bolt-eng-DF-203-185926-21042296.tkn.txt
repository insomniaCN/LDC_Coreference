I 've successfully gotten someone fired this week . Well , she is n't fired yet , but she will be very soon .
Note : She did it to herself , I just told her boss ( my part - time boss ) about what she was doing ( quoting insurance unlicensed and quoting it wrong , trying to insure people without driver 's licenses , leaving her tasks undone overnight and screwing around on FB instead ) and the other two people in that office , plus the one in her other office , got tired of it and once the agents found out , she was toast .
Not only that , but she told both of her bosses that she had to leave at noon on Thursday and be gone Friday to " speak at a college " ( about what ? ?) and because there was an all - district meeting and her boss was gone that morning , she left earlier than noon to get her eyebrows waxed and was n't planning on telling the boss and get paid for that extra 2 hours .

I 've gotten 2 negative pregnancy tests in the last week and I am still somehow convincing myself that they were wrong because I am " late " . Sigh ... but I am scared to take another one and be disappointed again .

But I have n't told work that I am pregnant yet ! Whoops .

I 'm having the strangest morning mentally . I think it 's the stress of everything I have going on with work . I 'm thinking things that are totally not like me and do n't make sense . Just need to get home to the hubs and relax tonight .

I want to throat punch my boss . Then quit . But I ca n't .
I drank 3 beers back to back last night . They were delicious . We 're getting take out buffalo wings tonight , and I 'll probably drink 3 more . It 's been a rough week .
I hate the DIY wreath trend .

I feel like 90 percent of the YHL threads on this board are started by girls who are new to the board and are trying to get attention or be cool . Every move they make some newbie makes a post about all excited and hoping to start a big slam fest , it 's a bit silly .

I watched about 50 seconds of the video posted and I think Sherry was a cute 17 year old .
And yes , the ZOMG THEY CONFESSED SOMETHING posts are silly about such trivial things .
Confession that they are robots ? Interesting .

I feel like its a race to see who can post about them first . Like " Guys , see see see ? Lookie ! Gues what ? OMGdo n't you just wan na all chat on my thread about this ? ? " 
I am not oppsosed to talking about their blog , I thouht the video was funny . But the amount of posts about their every little move is so silly , and seems to often come from people that are just seeking attention for themselves for being the first with breaking YHL news . Like being the girls chasing after the cool girl at school .
Anyway ... 
lol .

I spent all morning driving DH to work and then driving myself to a dr 's appt and back . I am trying to be lazy until I have to go get back to the car and drive an hr to work at 2 .... and I am now ignoring the fact that the dogs are ripping apart papers in the recycling bin . They are n't eating them , just making a mess .
