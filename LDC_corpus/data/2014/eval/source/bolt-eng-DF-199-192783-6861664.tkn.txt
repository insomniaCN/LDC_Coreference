I just heard that Cindy Sheehan has her eye on Dianne Feinstein 's Senate seat . And a lot of people are considering voting for her .

<a href= " http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2006/01/28/cindy-sheehan-considers-c_n_14648.html">The story< / a> 

Do you think she has a chance in hell ? I like Cindy Sheehan and agree with her causes , but I think she 's delusional if she thinks she can win against Feinstein .

I would vote for her though if I lived in California .

I was a big supporter but I think her grief is preventing her from thinking rationally . She has no chance against Feinstein . If she ran for Congress somewhere , she might have a chance , but not in a statewide Senate race and not against a longtime incumbent like Feinstein .

The article says that she is doing it to protest Feinstein 's support for the war in Iraq . So I kind of wonder how far she will take it . I do n't see Sheehan really spending a lot of money to campaign against Feinstein if it 's just a protest stunt .

On the other hand , Sheehan being a well known name her self , and this being California . I bet she could muster up 20 % of the votes without any real effort .

I 'm a californian and know a couple of people in relatively high state elective offices there , people who have worked their butts off for many years now - and I 'm not so keen on celeb candidates , especially when they win . While I have been against our invasion of Iraq from the getgo , I cringe at opportunism as a key boost to elective office .

Edit to say I know opportunism is part of it all anyway , but with the people I know , not so much a part .

Sheehan is not a celebrity , she is an activist . It is a logical step to run for office . But pay your dues first . City Council , State congresswoman or something . Threatening Feinstein with the threat to run is just silly .

I do n't see Sheehan as a celebrity , just a big name activist . On the other hand , given that Feinstein is pretty much guaranteed to win , a political battle with Sheehan could damage Feinsteins image if she is forced to defend her support for the war .

And , what 's the possibility of a 3rd candidate taking advantage of the situation and ending up getting more votes than Feinstine and Sheehan . I think Feinstine has some real troubles ahead . Why does n't Sheehan find a Republican to target ?

Yeah , that 's one of the main things I do n't like about it . Is it really the most useful thing she could be doing for her cause , or is it the one that gets her , personally , the most attention ?

Sure she is a activist , and I 'll give her credit for activity when many doze , but I still see her as a heat seeking celebrity - thus the choice of going for a senate seat instead of what I presume are myriad other possibilities for instigating change .
