Nicolas Hayek , chairman and former chief executive of the giant Swiss watch - manufacturing firm Swatch , has died . He was 82 .
< / P> 
<P> 
Swatch Group said Hayek died unexpectedly of heart failure Monday at his office in Biel , Switzerland .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Nicolas G . Hayek 's greatest merit was his enormous contribution to the saving of the Swiss watch industry and the foundation and the commercial development of the Swatch Group , " the company said in a statement .
< / P> 
<P> 
The self - styled Mr. Swatch is credited with reinventing Swiss watch - making in the 1980s by introducing radical cost - saving moves after he was asked to help close it down .

<P> 
When Swiss banks asked Hayek 's consultancy firm for a report on the Alpine country 's watch - making industry , the two main manufacturers were on the verge of bankruptcy . The banks thought Swiss watches could not compete with digital watches made in the Far East , as the makers did not want to abandon their high prices and were rapidly losing market share .
< / P> 
<P> 
Hayek maintained they could survive , by making less expensive products and charging a premium for top - of - the - range timepieces 'Made in Switzerland' -- the traditional home of precision timekeeping .
< / P> 
<P> 
Guided by Hayek 's consultancy , the watch - making companies merged to form SMH , in which Hayek bought a 51 percent share in 1984 . Hayek reasoned that a cheap watch could tell the time just as well as an expensive one and SMH started to produce a plastic wristwatch -- the Swatch -- which revolutionized the industry . SMH was renamed the Swatch Group in 1998 .

He introduced the use of plastic cases , quartz movements and mass - production to hold down prices of cheaper watches .
< / P> 
<P> 
Although the Swatch brand became a global fashion success , Hayek also made money from the company 's more upmarket brands , such as Breguet , Calvin Klein , Longines and Omega . " People buy these watches like others buy Picassos , " he told the International Herald Tribune in 2004 .

<P> 
Hayek became a national figure , respected as one of the economic leaders of Switzerland , despite his very un-Swiss flamboyance . In 1998 he came up with the idea for the ultra-compact Smart car , now made by a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler AG , saying a city car only needed " room for two big adults and a crate of beer . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
In recent years he became a vocal critic of the two big Swiss banks , Credit Suisse Group and UBS AG , saying their risky business practices were a threat to Switzerland 's economy .

<P> 
One of the richest people in Switzerland according to Swiss magazine Bilanz , Hayek was born in Beirut , Lebanon in 1928 . The family moved to Switzerland when he was 7 and Hayek went on to study chemistry , math and physics at France 's Lyon University .
< / P> 
<P> 
In 1963 he founded the management consultancy Hayek Engineering in Zurich , Switzerland , which has advised a wide variety of international companies including Nestle , Siemens and U.S. Steel .
< / P> 
<P> 
But Hayek 's big break came in 1982 with the famous report on watch - making . He was passionate about timepieces , telling the British weekly the Sunday Times that watches were " emotional products . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
" A watch is something people carry on their bare skin , sometimes 24 hours a day , " he explained in a 2000 interview . " We have to convince every individual that this particular watch fits his or her personal style and lifestyle to the best . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Known to wear up to four watches on each arm , Hayek said that Swatch produced " beauty , sensuality , emotionality in watches -- and we also produce high - tech on your wrists . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Hayek began to wind down his career when his son , Nick Hayek , took over as Swatch chief executive in 2003 . Hayek senior stayed on as president and remained active in the running of the company .

Details of other survivors and funeral arrangements were not immediately known .
