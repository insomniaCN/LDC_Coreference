According to The Sentinel , it 's at an office building and apparently the shooter is someone who used to work there , according to a witness . Sounds like a classic postal case .

exactly , times are hard with many out of work . Sorry to say we 'll probably see more cases like this if unemployment does n't get better in Florida .

I have family in Florida and reports from my sister are jobs are very scarce . When you have over 400 applicants with college degree 's applying for $ 11.50 hour job there is a problem .

Not trying to make political hay here but just stating the obvious . Hard times will make anyone with emotional instability to crack .

I 'm down her in Florida and the guys have been following this story since it happened . Apparantly the guy was a fired disgruntled worker . The media down here is doing pretty much what the media did yesterday at Ft. Hood . Lots of airtime , not much info .

It 's a frequent pattern . One person goes on a shooting rampage followed by one or more " copycats " . Unfortunately I expect there will be more in the coming weeks or months . I hope and pray I 'm wrong .
