A judge will hear arguments Friday to determine if Roman Polanski could be sentenced in absentia in California for his decades - old sex case .
< / P> 
<P> 
Polanski 's attorneys have said the 76 - year - old film director should be sentenced in absentia to time served after pleading guilty to one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 13 - year - old girl . Prosecutors have insisted Polanski must appear in a Los Angeles courtroom .

<P> 
Polanski , arrested on a U.S. warrant , spent more than 60 days in a Swiss jail before being transferred to house arrest in his Swiss vacation home Dec . 4 .

An attorney for Polanski 's victim also urged Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza to have the director sentenced in absentia .

<P> 
Espinoza 's ruling would not have an immediate impact because either side would likely appeal his decision .

<P> 
Polanski fled to France in 1978 and was a fugitive until his arrest last year .

Michael Brennan , a law professor at the University of Southern California , said it 's " highly unusual " for a defendant to be sentenced in absentia , but he believes Espinoza could grant the defense motion if he decides Polanski should n't serve any further time in prison .
< / P> 
<P> 
" I think the judge most likely is going to require Polanski to come back for sentencing , unless he imposes a time - served sentence , " Brennan said . " It does n't make any sense to have him come back " if Polanski is n't ordered to go back to prison , he said .

<P> 
In court documents , Polanski 's attorneys said the late Superior Court Judge Laurence J . Rittenband sentenced the director to a diagnostic study at a California prison where he served 42 days . Although the judge told attorneys this would be Polanski 's full sentence he later indicated he was going to renege on the bargain and give him a harsher sentence at a scheduled hearing . Polanski fled .
< / P> 
<P> 
His attorneys said the judge 's promise is binding and Polanski has served his full sentence . They have asked Espinoza for a full hearing with witnesses about allegations of judicial and prosecutorial misconduct in the case .
