As it gives the USA a reason to maintain a military presence in South Korea and Japan .

If Korea united , it 's probably likely they 'd tell the USA to **** off and it 's likely Japan and Korea would aim to become a major regional power in their own right instead of just being satellite states of the USA .

The question is , would it be beneficial for Russia , China or Japan to instigate the situation in North Korea to prompt America to attack ; something which would either : 

a ) End up in the uniting of Korea , and thus ending the reason for the USA to stay in the region .

b ) America getting absolutely dealt with and having to pull all troops out of the region due to unstable political situation at home and rising debts .

Anyone have any thoughts ?

I fail to see how Japan , Russia or China can instigate a direct war . Having said that , I quite like your logic about the benefit of North Korea not uniting with the South .

Firstly , the US maintains a military presence over there because it has bases in Japan anbd South Korea ( DMZ ) 

Secondly , after what Japan did to Korea in World War II why would the North suddenly decide to form an alliance ? 

Thirdly , why would the Korean peninsula be united ? 

Put yourself in South Korea 's shoes , would you really want to spend billions upon billions to revitalise the North 's economy , military , country and the rest of it ? 

Fourthly , why would Japan and South Korea want to lose arguably their biggest ally in terms or economic trade and military backing ? 

I do n't understand your logic ...

Why would the North and the South unite ? 

For fun ? 

No , seriously I think the creator of this topic is not looking at it from a strategic and economic point of view as it 's supposed to be looked at . As previous posts have hinted the conflict between the North and the South is one resulting in severe trauma and economic damage to both states .

Yet , one side recovered fairly quickly and managed to set up one of the most effective technology based industries in the world , the other seemingly lagged behind and relies on propaganda and terror to maintain its social stability ( in the presence of economic dysfunction ) . The North is seen as a state ruined by communism and dominated by poverty . This does not give the capitalist South a positive impression of their neighbors . It never did , and it never will .

Seeing as South Korea has the a good relationship with the US it is highly unlikely that they will even consider uniting with the North . They would not be willing to support in any way a country that has openly admitted to nuclear arms tests and refused to stop them in the near future . Therefore , your assumption is wrong and is in no way realistic .

Just some thoughts . I could go on about the strategic and economic alliance between Japan and the USA . The relationship between the South and Japan and why the North will be left forever in isolation ( even if they do , miraculously cancel any further plans for nuclear weapons and energy development ) .

Anyway , interesting discussion !
