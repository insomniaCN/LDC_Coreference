My wife had a minor scrape in a car park and the net result was a couple of scratches on both cars . She was at fault and asked the other driver to contact us so we make the situation good . Our garage reckoned our damage would cost Â£50 and his was less extensive ! 
We heard nothing and then got a letter from the insurance company saying he had submitted a claim . My wife texted him and he said " tough - I 'm getting a nice new bumper and the loss of your NCD will pay for it " . Or slightly blunter words to that effect .
Assuming he is correct do we have any rights to challenge the insurance company 's assessment who seem to have inflated the claim at the expense of our NCD !

Not really . It 's up to your insurers to decide how they want to settle a claim .
