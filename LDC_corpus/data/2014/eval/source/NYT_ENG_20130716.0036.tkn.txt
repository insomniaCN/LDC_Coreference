MOSCOW - Edward J . Snowden , the former intelligence contractor on the run from U.S. authorities , formally applied Tuesday for temporary asylum in Russia , citing fears that he could face torture or the death penalty if extradited to the United States , according to a Russian official who assisted in preparing the documents .

Snowden , whose leak of National Security Agency information has set off a worldwide debate over the U.S. government ’s surveillance programs , has not been accused of a capital crime and does not face the death penalty . His stated fears , whatever their merit , will help him to meet requirements for asylum in Russia .

President Vladimir Putin of Russia has said that he would consider allowing Snowden to stay in Russia , provided that he “ cease his work aimed at inflicting damage on our American partners . ” Putin reiterated that offer Monday while meeting with science students , but he said that Snowden had initially refused and that the situation remained uncertain . Snowden has said he does not believe his leaks have harmed U.S. interests .

The formal submission of the asylum application Tuesday seemed to clear things up - at least for the moment - and suggested that the end of Snowden ’s sojourn at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow , where he arrived from Hong Kong on June 23 , might finally be in sight .

WikiLeaks , the anti-secrecy organization , which has been assisting Snowden , posted a message on Twitter confirming the submission of his asylum application .

During a meeting Friday with human rights advocates and lawyers , Snowden said he would request temporary shelter in Russia but ultimately planned to travel to Latin America , where three countries have expressed a willingness to take him . He accused the United States of violating international law by blocking him from traveling there straight away .

<P> 
Anatoly Kucherena , a rights advocate who has worked closely with the Kremlin , who was one of the officials to meet with Snowden on Friday , confirmed the submission of the asylum application . In an interview on the Rossiya 24 television station , Kucherena said he had helped Snowden prepare the documents at the airport and had delivered them to the Federal Migration Service , which handles such requests .

<P> 
The Kremlin did not offer any immediate assessment of Snowden ’s chances . Putin ’s spokesman , Dmitri S . Peskov , told Russian news agencies that the Migration Service was handling the application . He said Putin , who was traveling in the Far East and Siberia on Tuesday , was focused on domestic issues .

In the past week a number of prominent Russians , many of them conservative - leaning Kremlin loyalists , have spoken in Snowden ’s favor , characterizing him as a whistle - blower and a defender of human rights who was deserving of protection .

<P> 
Federal prosecutors in Virginia have charged Snowden with two counts of violating the Espionage Act and also with stealing government property - each charge punishable by up to 10 years in prison , for a total of 30 years .
< / P> 
<P> 
But Snowden and his supporters in and outside of Russia have cited the existence of the death penalty in the United States as a reason he should not be extradited , noting that U.S. officials have said he could face additional charges .
