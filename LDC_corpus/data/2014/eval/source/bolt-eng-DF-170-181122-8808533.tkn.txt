" Ca n't We All Get Along ? " - Apparently , Rodney Still Does n't Know How

RIALTO , Calif . Â— Rodney King , whose videotaped beating by Los Angeles police led to deadly riots in 1992 , was arrested after he allegedly threatened his daughter and ex-girlfriend , police said .

King , 40 , was arrested Wednesday on suspicion of making criminal threats . He was being held on $ 25,000 bail .

He was accused of threatening to kill his 23 - year - old daughter , Candace , and her mother , Carmen Simpson , after the two got in a fight with King 's current girlfriend , Dawn Jean . All three women live in King 's home .

The daughter , who called police , said King was armed with a handgun , but it turned out to be a toy , according to authorities .

King 's videotaped beating after he was stopped for speeding shocked the nation when it was shown repeatedly on television newscasts . After the four white police officers charged in the beating were acquitted of most charges , Los Angeles erupted in riots that left 55 people dead and caused $ 1 billion in property damage .

King sued the city for the beating , eventually settling for $ 3.8 million .

Since the beating , he has had a string of run - ins with the law . He walks with a limp since a 2003 accident in which he lost control of his car , crashed into a house at 100 mph and shattered his pelvis .

You 've obviously never lived with a nagging woman . Only a few things bother me ... Nuclear War ... Carnies ... and Women who fight , hit , yell and scream , only to play the victim when they get smacked .

I know a guy who walked in on his wife and another man . He smacked her . SHE called police , and had him arrested .

So where does the use of violence come in ? In this hypothetical situation , are you suggesting that the girl actively seeks the man out to use violence against him or that she uses violence against the guy as self defense ? Because self defense is always okay . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/new/dance.gif"/>

What would anyone do when they caught their spouse engadged in a act of this type ... well speaking from experience ... many decades ago I walked in on my first wife in the same situation ... as related in this post ... at the time I worked for LAPD ... when the young man hurriedly got out of the bed I threw him a hard right ... he went sailing into a rocking chair my wifes dad had given us .. it broke on impact .. I started to laugh as I did not like the chair or my father - in - law .
The young man said ... I did not know she was married ... I apologized to him and threw him $ 20.00 and told him to go get a good piece .. I told her to pack her shit and get ... Justice was served ! : halo :

But battered wife syndrome comes from being battered . So killing the guy would still be in self defense and therefore justified .

The problem with battered wife syndrome is that it 's hard to prove unless there has been documentation in photos and police reports . That 's a good lesson to keep in mind ladies . Do n't put up with any physical abuse ever . Document it and file a police report and hold it over the c * cksucker 's head for the rest of his life if you have to . There are enough gorillas living in the zoos , we do n't have to put up with them living among us .

And for god 's sake , do n't live with an abusive sh * thead . Move out , get a divorce and a restraining order .

After many years of responding to domestic abuse I found for the most part mental abuse was about equal ... and men are more powerful so when they hit back it is usually more severe ... . sometimes women do instigate the physical abuse by mental abuse and also hit first ... In a perfect world all would just walk away ... but human emotion is a powerful thing ! : coffee3 :

i think your missing what i m trying to convey . breaking someones mind after years of mental abuse will do strange things to people . the abused will think totally diffferent . its ground into their heads that this is going to happen , they know for certain its going to happen .

Yeah , I live in the US . I 've heard of mental battery . But what does that have to do with physical battery ? Are you asking if I think mental battery could provoke a person to violence against the batterer ? The answer is " of course . " It 's been documented in many cases where a woman kills her husband and then claims that the husband mentally abused her and drove her to kill him out of fear for her own life .

The key phrase here is " fear for her own life . " So if an array of mental battery totally conviced someone that their life was at stake , then I think they would have a good argument that they were forced to kill out of self defense . This would be totally morally justified , but , like physical battery , it would be hard to prove without evidence to support the claims . You 'd have to have recordings , journal entries , or witnesses to prove a claim like that . And even then , I think a " man slaughter " conviction might still be a just punishment for a person like this because unless they were actually being attacked at the time they chose to defend themselves ( in which case it would just be a cut and dry self defense case ) , they would still have set out to commit murder . It 's mighty complex and ugly .

It looks like Rodney has a bad case of 'Battered Idiot 's Syndrome ' .

Some of the symptoms are : 

1 . You can say anything you want and get in the news .
2 . You tell people on the news to do what you are unwilling to do and then go and do the opposite ... 

I hear that a prescription of " shut the f * * k up " when filled properly can solve this problem .
