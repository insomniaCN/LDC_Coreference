" To change the purpose and charter of the military . " Joseph Stalin / Barack Obama 

What do you think ? Social engineering in the name of diversity ? 

In the past five years the Obama administration has fired 197 high ranking officers , mostly warriors with combat experience and replaced them with politically correct officers with no combat experience .

Is the Obama adminstration saying there are n't any Halsey 's , Nimitz , John Paul Jone 's serving in todays PC Navy ? 

& gt ; " Vice Adm. Michelle Howard has been nominated to serve the second in command of the U.S. Navy , making her the first African American female to be nominated for the rank of admiral , the service told USNI News on Friday .

Howard , if confirmed , will replace current Vice Chief of Naval Operations ( VCNO ) , Adm. Mark E . Ferguson , for the position serving directly under CNO Adm. Jonathan Greenert .

Ferguson , in turn , has been nominated to command the U.S. Navys forces in Europe , Africa and lead Allied Joint Forces Command in Naples , Italy .

Howard is a 1982 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and was the first African American woman to command a U.S. Navy ship  USS Rushmore ( LSD - 47 )  in 1999 .

She has also commanded the Amphibious Squadron Seven , Expeditionary Strike Group Two and Task Force 151  the U.S. led multi-national anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia .

Howard is currently the Deputy CNO for Operations , Plans and Strategy ( N3 / N5 ) .

If confirmed by the Senate , Howard will be the first female four star in the Navy . In 2008 U.S. Army Gen. Ann E . Dunwoody became the first female officer in U.S. military history to earn a fourth star .

Howards nomination is following a trend from the Obama administration to place more women in higher defense positions .

Earlier this month the administration nominated Christine Fox as the acting deputy secretary of defense  the Pentagons number two civilian official . " & lt ;

This probably is a race based decision . I just hope it is n't .

There are some great black people out there , you know ... 

I would vote for a David Palmer any day . Never for a Barack Obama .

There can also be ' reading too much into ' something . If she has made it this far , she is probably qualified . It is probably likely that she 's been thrown a bone or two throughout her career because the military is actively looking for more diversity in the higher ranks , but she apparently is tenacious enough to undergo many challenges unique to female military officers which is admirable . All in all , it 's just way too early to start throwing stones .

I will not say she is n't qualified . She very likely is . My question is this . Is it a PC decision that passed up better qualified candidates , or not ? 

We probably will never know at our level .

While I ca n't speak about this hire , I do believe the Obama Administration is weeding out everyone who does not fall in lock step with their agenda . Gen Mattis of the Marine Corps is a great example . The guy could n't have been more accomplished but was pushed out of the door . He had years left to serve . He definitely should have been our Commandant instead of the weak little aviator we got . But I guess the warfighters are being put back under glass as their is no need for their skills anymore .

So race is a different matter when people slam Obama over faux outrage on racism .
Then , it 's not only okay to insuate racism , but it 's flat - out okay on Debate Politics to keep accusing Obama of everything vile , this time racism .

Would anyone be making a stink of this if she had been appointed under Bush ( not you , but generally ) ? Let 's not forget this woman 's career began in the 80s . We will never know , as you say , but I think when you get to that level you 're more of a policy paper pusher I would imagine and your success depends on how well you play the political game these days . I 'm sure if there were better qualified candidates , she would n't have been the first person ever picked for something that someone else was more qualified for . And we 're just fine .

It was Obama and Gates who nominated Mattis to be CENTCOM commander after Petraeus vacated the position - seems he was among Obama 's favored generals . I have n't seen any evidence to suggest that his not being commandant was due to Obama as opposed to internal politics within the Corps leadership ...
