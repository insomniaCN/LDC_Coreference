Boston Mayor Tom Menino turned down a bet last May with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford on the outcome of a Bruins - Maple Leafs hockey playoff series . Apparently Menino can smell a troublemaker 429 miles away .

Since that time , Ford has imploded . A video of the out - of - control mayor smoking crack has fallen into the hands of police . A photo of Ford consorting with suspected gang members has been posted on the Internet . A video shows him in full rant threatening to rip out the throat and poke out the eyes of some real or imagined political enemy . He admits to driving under the influence of alcohol . And on Monday , the 300 - pound Ford pancaked Pam McConnell , a petite city councilor , in his rush to confront jeering members of the public in Toronto ’s council chamber .

Ford could benefit from some time in what psychiatrists politely refer to as a therapeutic milieu . And if his rampages continue at the current level , the milieu might need to come equipped with a tranquilizer dart gun and an ample supply of leg and arm restraints .

Ford is hardly the first mayor to go wild in office . Yet there is no method to his madness , unlike the seemingly bizarre actions of other municipal leaders . Take the case of Vilnius Mayor Arturas Zuokas . In 2011 , he commandeered an armored personnel carrier and crushed a Mercedes Benz that was illegally parked in a bike lane in the Lithuanian capital . Over the top ? Sure . But Zuokas ’s action showed creativity and civic spirit in a way that smoking crack cocaine never could .

Reykjavik Mayor Jon Gnarr favors Jedi robes as office wear . Last year , he rode through the streets of the Icelandic capital wearing a pink dress and mouthing the lyrics to songs by Pussy Riot , an all - female Russian punk band whose leader was locked up in Siberia after a musical protest . Unusual fashion choices ? Maybe . But Gnarr succeeded at drawing attention to the plight of political dissidents . Ford ’s antics only draw attention to himself .

Toronto ’s city council has stripped Ford of his substantive duties . And there are calls for provincial officials to intervene and remove Ford by amending the charter of Canada ’s largest city . But the current cuckooness glosses over how Ford managed to convince voters to elect him to the mayor ’s seat back in 2010 . His proclivity for erratic behavior and boorishness was already known from his days serving on the city council . The answer , it turns out , speaks volumes about the deepest concern of many city dwellers -- waste in government .

During the campaign , Ford impressed voters with his promise to ' ' end the gravy train ’ ' of runaway spending by a progressive city administration . Toronto Life columnist Philip Preville and others have pointed out that the newly elected Ford made good on that promise . Ford aligned himself with fiscal conservatives , dissolved the board of the city ’s incompetent housing authority , outsourced much of the city ’s trash collection , trimmed the city budget , and negotiated union contracts that did n’t soak Toronto taxpayers . He also takes a keen interest in finding solutions to residents ’ problems -- and takes their calls personally .

' 'Are you aware that 2,200 people call me ? ' ' he demanded of critics who are calling for his resignation . Even while fighting -- unsuccessfully -- with his personal demons , Ford manages to keep a count of constituent calls .

City dwellers will put up with a lot of nonsense from any mayor who takes tight fiscal control of the city and responds to them personally . Not as much nonsense as Ford is dishing out , mind you . But a lot .

Author Benjamin Barber cites the prominent features of a successful urban mayor in his new book , ' 'If Mayors Ruled the World . ' ' Chief among them is ' ' a preference for pragmatism and problem solving over ideology and principled grandstanding . '' Ford , for all his problems , fits that definition .

Perhaps there is a lesson here for Boston Mayor - elect Marty Walsh . Walsh is the personal antithesis of Ford : sober , thoughtful , and discerning . He is a man of principle -- a self - professed ' ' son of labor ’ ' who ' ' will wear my record of fighting for working people as a badge of honor . '' Yet 48 percent of voters rejected Walsh in the recent election , many of then fearful that his close ties to organized labor would translate into bloated public payrolls and higher property taxes .

Even in Boston -- with its Puritan roots -- many residents might be tempted to opt for a wild man who respects their wallets over a fastidious gentleman who does n’t .
