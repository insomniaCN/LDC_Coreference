Right after I got home from work , our doorbell rang . It was a new neighbor who lives a few doors down . We 've waved to each other before , but never really spoken .
She had an edible arrangement for us . EA tried to deliver it to our home around noon , but since we were n't home , they left it with the closest home neighbor . weird .
Anyways , the EA was n't for us . It was addressed to the guy we bought our house from in November 2009 . It was sent from his work ( info courtesy of a public linkedin account ) with a message for a " speedy recovery . " 
I called EA around 6 pm and explained the situation in case they wanted to come pick it back up . EA said they would call me back right away after talking ot the manager . It 's now 845 pm with no call back .
Here 's the dilemma : it 's in our fridge , and the chocolate covered strawberries look delicious .
WWYD ? They would n't leave a EA at someone 's house overnight and then ask for it back , right ?

The thought of the company giving that arrangement to somebody else after a botched delivery is crazy .
You should eat it .
Not your problem .

They are n't going to come pick it up from you and give it to him . At least I hope not ! If anything , they 'll make a new one and send it to him . Eat away !

Eat it ! We got Hope 's Cookies delivered to our house for the old people from a law firm for Christmas , and I gobbled them up without a second thought . It would be gross for a company like EA to pick up fruit from your house and deliver it from someone else . It 's yours , now : - )

Excellent reminder why it is so important to update your address with HR . You might miss an Edible Arrangement !!
