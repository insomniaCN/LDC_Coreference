Ethnic tensions flare at judicial meeting

<P> 
Tears were shed and Hitler was quoted on Wednesday , as ethnic tensions erupted at the State House and threatened to derail Governor Deval Patrick ’s nominee for a seat on the Superior Court .
< / P> 
<P> 
The charged struggle centers around the leadership role that the nominee , Joseph S . Berman , has played in the Anti-Defamation League , a national organization dedicated to combating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination .
< / P> 
<P> 
Berman ’s nomination stirred opposition because , for years , the organization refused to label as genocide the slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1923 , a stance that angered the Armenian community . But in 2007 , the organization reversed course and called the slaughter ' ' tantamount to genocide , '' quieting the controversy until it flared again around Berman ’s nomination .
< / P> 
<P> 
A commercial litigation lawyer from Weston , Berman has been a national commissioner of the organization since 2006 , and a member of its regional board and executive committee .
< / P> 
<P> 
At Wednesday ’s meeting of the Governor ’s Council , the elected eight - member panel that approves judicial nominations , Councilor Marilyn M . Pettito Devaney led the opposition to Berman , saying she had the five votes needed to reject his nomination .
< / P> 
<P> 
Devaney , a Democrat from Watertown , home to a large Armenian community , stood and denounced Berman ’s affiliation with the Anti-Defamation League , as the governor looked on , chagrined .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'In 1939 , Hitler , carrying out his horrific mission to exterminate the Jews , said , 'Who remembers the Armenians ? ' ' ' Devaney said , her voice trembling and eyes filling with tears . ' 'I do . And many others do , too . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Devaney said if she belonged to ' ' a group who denied the Holocaust , ' ' she would resign . Several other councilors agreed that Berman ’s ties to the Anti-Defamation League are a concern , while raising their own separate objections .
< / P> 
<P> 
Patrick , who chairsthe Governor ’s Council , postponed the vote on Berman ’s nomination until Dec . 4 , forestalling an embarrassing political defeat . The governor called Berman ' ' more than ready to serve ’ ' on the Superior Court .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'I ’m going to work hard to get the votes , '' Patrick told the councilors . ' 'I have n’t had an opportunity to do that . I ’m not ready today . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Several councilors strongly objected to the delay and urged Patrick to allow them to vote immediately on Berman ’s nomination .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'We ’re not going to change our minds , '' Devaney said . ' 'To prolong this serves no purpose . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Councilor Terrence W. Kennedy agreed , saying that even though he supports Berman , a delay will not save the nomination .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'It ’s a democracy , and I do n’t think the vote is going to change , '' he told Patrick .
< / P> 
<P> 
Typically , the lieutenant governor would chair meetings of the council , a fractious and often rebellious panel that dates to the Colonial era . But because Timothy P . Murray resigned as lieutenant governor in May , Patrick has had to fill that role .
< / P> 
<P> 
The fight over Berman ’s nomination harkens back to the bitter controversy over the Armenian genocide that engulfed the Anti-Defamation League six years ago .
< / P> 
<P> 
In 2007 , the organization fired its New England regional director , Andrew H . Tarsy , after he broke rank with national leadership and said it should acknowledge the genocide .
< / P> 
<P> 
The organization had expressed concern that doing so could harm Israel ’s relations with Turkey , a rare Muslim ally .
< / P> 
<P> 
Many Jewish and Armenian leaders in New England criticized Tarsy ’s firing and urged the organization to recognize the genocide . After several days of outcry , the national director , Abraham H . Foxman , issued a statement in 2007 calling the massacre of Armenians ' ' tantamount to genocide ’ ' but stopping short of labeling it an actual genocide .
< / P> 
<P> 
Anti-Defamation League leaders said Wednesday that that phrase is not meant to obscure the historical suffering of Armenians .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'ADL policy right now is crystal clear : that we recognize the Armenian genocide , '' said Robert O . Trestan , director of the New England Anti-Defamation League . ' 'We ’re on the record making that recognition more than five years ago , and we ’ve moved on from the issue , and it does n’t seem appropriate , more than five years later , to bring this up in light of a judicial nomination . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Reached by phone on Wednesday , Berman declined to discuss the issue .
< / P> 
<P> 
Councilors have also objected to Berman because he donated about $ 110,000 to Democratic candidates over the last decade , contributions that they say make it appear as though his nomination was a reward for his financial support . In addition , at least one criticized his nomination because he once represented a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay .
< / P> 
<P> 
Jeffrey S . Robbins , the chair of the board of the New England Anti-Defamation League , was among those who testified in support of Berman at his nomination hearing last week .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'The assault on Joe Berman is particularly egregious ’ ' because Berman was one of the most vocal and effective voices within the organization urging it to acknowledge the massacre as a genocide , Robbins said .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'That ’s the kind of courage and principle that should be rewarded , and not penalized , '' he said .
