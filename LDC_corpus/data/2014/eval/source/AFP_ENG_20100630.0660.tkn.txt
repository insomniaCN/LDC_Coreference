At least 15,000 protesting garment factory workers blocked key roads in the 
Bangladeshi capital Dhaka Wednesday , the latest in a string of protests over low 
wages and poor conditions .
< / P> 
<P> 
Police fired tear gas and used water cannons to disperse the workers , who sew 
clothes for some of the top names in Western retail , after they blocked a major 
intersection in the north of the city .

" There are 15,000 to 20,000 workers massing in the street , holding protests over 
benefits and wages . They blocked a main road and hurled bricks at police , " 
Dhaka 's deputy police commissioner , Salim M . Jahangir , told AFP .

<P> 
The trouble began at four factories , owned by one of the country 's leading 
garment manufacturers , and then spread to all of the dozens of factories along a 
five - kilometre ( three - mile ) stretch of road in the Kafrul and Mirpur areas .
< / P> 
<P> 
" All workers in the area have walked out of the factories and joined protests , " 
he said .

The unrest is the latest in a series of violent protests over low wages in 
Bangladesh 's more than 4,500 garment factories -- the mainstay of the 
impoverished country 's economy .

<P> 
Last week hundreds of factories in a key industrial zone outside the capital 
were briefly shut down following days of violent protests which owners said 
created " panic and anarchy . "

<P> 
The factories were reopened a day later after the government brought in nearly a 
thousand riot police to guarantee security .

Bangladeshi workers , who make clothes for major Western brands such as Wal - Mart 
and H & amp ; M , have been demanding wages of at least 5,000 taka ( 70 dollars ) a 
month . The current minimum wage is just 25 dollars .

<P> 
The government has said it would raise the salaries of the country 's three 
millions garment workers by end of July and urged them to be patient .

Garments accounted for nearly 80 percent of Bangladesh 's 15.56 billion dollars 
of exports last year . The factories employ around 40 percent of the industrial 
workforce .

Retailers including French giant Carrefour and Levi Strauss wrote to the prime 
minister in January requesting across - the - board wage increases .
< / P> 
<P> 
Current wages are " below the poverty line " and have " contributed to unrest " 
among workers , the letter said .
