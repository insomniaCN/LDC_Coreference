Luis Posada Carriles was once on the CIA 's payroll and is alleged to have bombed a civilian airplane ; despite this it 's possible that the US will let him walk 
By Laura Bonilla 
AFP , WASHINGTON 
Friday , May 20 , 2005 , Page 9 

The arrest of accused airline bomber Luis Posada Carriles in Florida poses a thorny problem for US President George W. Bush , who has vowed to battle terrorism anywhere , analysts said .

Federal agents arrested Posada Carriles , 77 , on Tuesday , two hours after giving a press conference with selected reporters at a secret location in Miami .

Declassified US documents released last week link Posada Carriles to the bombing of a Cubana airliner in 1976 , in which 73 people died . They also said the CIA paid him US$ 300 a month in the 1960s , and he worked for the CIA at least from 1965 until June 1976 .

He has already been found guilty for an attempt to assassinate Cuban President Fidel Castro during a summit in Panama in 2000 , but was pardoned last year .
Venezuela has demanded his extradition . They want Posada Carriles , a naturalized Venezuelan , to stand trial for the plane bombing , which happened over Venezuelan territory .

Cuba also wants Posada Carriles for the 1997 bombings of Havana hotels , one of which killed an Italian tourist . Posada Carriles admitted in a New York Times interview that he plotted the bombings , though he later recanted the admission .
Washington has so far avoided extraditing Posada Carriles , citing doubts about Venezuela 's court system or that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez would send the suspect to Cuba , where he would likely face execution .

" The Bush administration , the White House , is on the horns of a dilemma , because on the one hand they do n't want to hand Posada Carriles over to antagonist countries , either Cuba or Venezuela , but obviously it 's not acceptable to just let him remain free in Miami , " said Dan Erickson , a Cuba expert at the Inter-American Dialogue , a Washington think - tank .

" He 's obviously not concerned that the US government may hand him over for extradition , " he said .

Posada Carriles granted an interview that ran in the Tuesday edition of El Nuevo Herald , the Spanish version of the Miami Herald . And on Tuesday afternoon he held the " secret " press conference .

" By giving these media interviews Posada Carriles turned himself into a political hot potato that the US had no option but to catch , " Erickson said . " The preference clearly was to try to stay out of this case , but that just became impossible once he 's giving this high - profile , front - page interviews . " 

The options seem to be to keep him in custody in a legal limbo -- since he faces no crimes in the US -- or to find a third country to send him to .
" There 's always an option of course of actually of putting him on trial " in the US , Erickson said . " He might even be acquitted . " 

Department of Homeland Security officials have up to 48 hours to decide Posada Carriles 's migratory status . The alleged bomber claims to have illegally crossed the Mexican border into the US .

Up to now , US officials said they did not know his whereabouts , and pointedly declined to describe him as a terrorist .

For William Rogers , former US assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , the costs of not extraditing Posada Carriles " are not trivial . " 

A refusal to extradite him " will be interpreted throughout the hemisphere as US acceptance of terrorism as long as the terrorist act was directed against a regime we do n't like , " said Rogers , writing in Inter-American Dialogue .

For Philip Peters , a Cuba expert at the Lexington Institute , a " very destructive message will be sent if the White House lowers those standards for what the world will surely interpret as electoral reasons . " 

The failure to treat Posada Carriles as a suspected terrorist " would tell the Cuban people that while Washington stands for democracy , at times it also accommodates a tiny expatriate minority that would kill Cuban civilians to achieve it , " he said .

For Erickson , " the question is does the US really consider terrorism conducted against Cuba to be fundamentally different to the other types of terrorism that the US is fighting ? " 

" So far the answer appears to be yes , " he said .

“ Electoral reasons “ as one variable in the decision not to extradite ? 

What electoral reasons ? 

I would have thought that the only foreign policy issue with any “ electoral ” heft is Iraq and the hardy perennial of Israel , leaving Cuba a distant bad memory and Venezuela probably not even on the radarscope .

Convict him if there 's enough evidence , and string him up . I would n't give the tyrant Castro the satisfaction of an extradition .

The broad consensus here so far is for an extradition and IMO rightly so .

The Bush Administration however seems to be taking an opposing view , or if not an opposing view , certainly one of playing for time by throwing up legal / procedural hurdles . Not a bad strategy if not extraditing is the objective given that Posada Carrilles is 77 : 

<a href= " http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/27/AR2005052701245.html">Request for Posada Denied< / a> 

Might have managed to stumble onto what could be “ electoral reasons ” for not extraditing . Presumably it is related to President Bush ’s brother being Florida ’s Governor .

I 'd try him here . If you send him to Cuba , there 'll be a show trail followed by a firing squad . If he 's convicted in the US , I 'll shoot him my self .

Personally i think extradite him . On the basis he is a suspected terrorist that another country wants to deal with .

If Zarqawi or Bin Laden et al turned up in some non-aligned country i am sure the US would want to try them under US jurisdiction and so on .

Big difference though , he 's going to get a fair trial HERE , and that 's something that is absolutely NOT going to happen in Cuba OR Venezuela . Both of those countries ' legal systems are a joke .

Keep in mind that he is ALLEGED to have done these things . And I do n't trust but a handful of countries in the world - especially NOW - to try American citizens . Especially one allegedly employed by the CIA . Anybody here want to argue that most countries would LOVE to tar the US with some CIA terrorism ? Whatcha bet he 'd be found guiltyguiltyguilty in either Cuba or Venezuela , whether it 's true or not ? 

And finally , this article was posted up by our ole buddy Trooth . Although I 'm not saying the article is wrong in the slightest detail ( as I ca n't know the accuracy or lack thereof myself - but I can have my suspicions ) , we all know he just luuuurves to get all righteously indignant about the bad ole 'Merkins , and there is simply NOTHING he wo n't believe we 're capable of - ' specially us bloodthirsty intel / spook types . He dam ' sure would n't want to go into this in any detail if he thought for a moment the US rides off into the sunset while the credits roll after savin ' the town .

Bluesman , 

These FBI and CIA documents declassified under the Freedom Of Information Act suggests that Posada Carriles is not , as you have put it “ ALLEGED to have done these things ” but more likely , “ alleged to have done these things ” with a stronger base to the " alleged " than you have suggested :

The National Security Archive quoted by Hari Om is run by leftists who used to work for an organization , the Institute for Policy Studies ( IPS ) , that is affiliated with the Nation , America 's most influential anti-American magazine . Here 's an interesting excerpt about the IPS 's activities with regard to advancing Communist interests in the Americas : 

It was Kissinger 's intercession , for instance , that brought about the release of Orlando Letelier , who served the Allende régime in a variety of posts , including ambassador to the United States and Minister of Defence . He also served the Soviet Union and Cuba , as an agent of influence for the K . G . B . and the D . G . I .. When Letelier was murdered by a car bomb in Washington , D . C . in 1976 , he was catapulted to special sainthood status in the Communist martyrology by the C . F . R . - dominated U.S. media . Letelier was killed just as he was preparing to head for Cuba with a briefcase full of incriminating documents . Those " Letelier Papers " revealed a great deal about Soviet espionage - disinformation - strategic deception operations in America and the amazing network of professional radicals , politicians , government officials , and journalists who were ( and in many cases , still are ) aiding these operations . Letelier operated principally through the Institute for Policy Studies ( I . P . S . ) , a Marxist front for Soviet - Cuban intelligence , and the I . P . S . spin - off known as the Transnational Institute .

The contents of Letelier 's briefcase showed not only that he was regularly receiving and disbursing funds from Soviet and Cuban intelligence services , but that he also had good contacts on Capitol Hill and in the Executive Branch . His contacts included Senators Ted Kennedy , George McGovern , Hubert Humphrey , and James Abourezk ; Representatives John Conyers , Bella Abzug , George Miller , and Toby Moffett ; Assistant Secretary of State William D . Rogers ( C . F . R . ) ; and Sol Linowitz ( C . F . R . ) , later head of the U.S. negotiating team for the treacherous Carter - Torrijos treaties on the Panama Canal .

Without an understanding of this ongoing network , it is impossible for Americans to understand the forces and motives behind the current campaign against Pinochet . Peter Kornbluh , for instance , heads a private ( but official - sounding ) outfit called the National Security Archive . He has received much attention lately for publicising documents released by the Clinton Administration purporting to show President Pinochet 's culpability for various crimes with which he has been charged . What no one in the media has bothered to point out is that Kornbluh is a veteran apparatchik from the I . P . S . - Letelier network . It was Kornbluh who arranged the crucial meeting between the Sandinista junta leaders and Senators John Kerry and Tom Harkin , just eight hours before the congressional vote on aid to the Contras . The senators ' trip provided a huge propaganda coup that is credited with stopping the aid .

Working with Kornbluh then was Reed Brody ( C . F . R . ) , a former New York Assistant Attorney - General and member of the pro-Communist National Lawyers Guild . He is the author of the 1985 " Brody Report , " which was published by the radical Washington Office on Latin America ( W.O . L . A . ) , one of the I . P . S . network affiliates , as a propaganda gift to the Communist Sandinista régime in Managua . Brody now works at Human Rights Watch , which is prominent among those attacking Pinochet . Although he is often quoted by the major media , typically his left - wing pedigree and work for the Sandinista régime are never mentioned .

The governments of the United States , England and Spain still include alumni from the old I . P . S . / Communist network . The most notorious of the I . P . S . veterans in the Clinton camp were Anthony Lake ( C . F . R . ) and Morton Halperin ( C . F . R . ) , both of whom played key roles during the Carter Administration 's " human rights " attacks on anti-Communist governments . Another Carter retread was I . P . S . cadre David L . Aaron ( C . F . R . ) , a Marxist who worked with Letelier . He held various posts in the Clinton régime , such as ambassador to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . Further , Karl F . Inderfurth ( C . F . R . ) , a former staff member of Senator Frank Church 's Select Committee on Intelligence , " briefed " by Communist agent Letelier in Letelier 's home on multiple occasions , used this Soviet - supplied disinformation in attacks on U.S. intelligence , and was appointed by Clinton to the U.S. mission to the United Nations .

The bottom line is that I would n't trust any of the documents that they claim were obtained via FOIA .

How does the affiliation of an organisation matter in judging the credibility or otherwise , short of the faking or doctoring ( which I ’ll come to later ) , of declassified GOTUS documents legally obtained .

Some may detest Lima Beans , but would the credibility of the declassified document be detracted from , purely on the grounds the it was obtained under the FOIA by the National Lima Beans Association ? OTOH some may love all things Pakistani , but would the credibility of the declassified document be enhanced purely on the grounds the it was obtained under the FOIA by the Pakistani Union of Shariah Scholars of Yuba ? 

Your statement that that National Security Archive is “ leftist ” and carries the taint of being “ anti-American ” IMO is as of now on shaky ground . You will no doubt be building a stranger case .

I say that as the funding for the NSA comes from a clutch of Foundation ’s spawned by the Icon ’s of American Capitalism such as the Ford Foundation . If these Foundations spawned by the Icons of American Capitalism have now imbibed the concepts of Dictatorship of the proletariat and Hegelian dialecticism , its passed me by . Do educate .

Also , the Board of Directors of the NSA includes a retired USAF General , who served as Deputy Commander of NATO , an organisation if you recollect was formed to stop the leftist communist scourge .

I trust you will not take offence when I say that I am more inclined to believe patriotic behaviour on the part of someone who put his life on the line for his country to stop the leftist communist scourge , rather than believe someone I am not even sure is an American citizen .

On the issue of faking or doctoring declassified GOTUS documents , I am sure that would be easy to prove .

Call for the same document under FOIA and compare for doctoring . Once GOTUS has taken a decision to declassify a document getting a second copy should not be difficult . For fake document 's again simply call for them under the FOIA and when the GOTUS discloses it does not exist , the NSA 's game will be up .
