My friend and i have suddenly grown closer over the past two years , and we have now become BEST FRIENDS . she s the friend i had never had . and i m not ashamed to say that i love her as a mate , we talk , we laugh and we have fun , she s a lovely girl .. BUT .
about a year ago she started talking about this guy , and then another , and then another . she likes to think they re all her " boyfriends " but actually they all just send dirty texts to one another , every time we talk its like : its mine and " his " anniversary , i m giving him my virginity !! " and they re not even friends on facebook . i get the feeling he does nt even know her last name .. 
Then she met " x " a guy who s slightly older , and has had a disturbed , dangerous and probably highly illegal past . they ve become very close and all of a sudden she s acting " bad " pretending to have a smoking habbit , telling me she used to smoke before , when she did n't . she clearly lies about " NEEDING " a fag , its obvious , just because " x " smokes .
i think she thrives off being bad , because all she ever talks about is : plannin to have sex with her " boyfriend " while her parents are out of the house . or smoking in the garden so her parents do nt find out ... 
why is she acting all bad , all of a sudden ? why ca nt she just grow up ? its like she wants attention or something ? its not impressing me and it does nt make me jealous , so why does she do it ?

She s into bad boys because of course she tries to fit in .. Simply because its cool to smoke - Yeah it really is cool to smoke is n't it ? That s how i started , Simply because in college while i was doing my diploma in music .. I saw this hot girl by the smoking shelter ( area ) and i thought to get into a conversation , i 'd have to start smoking to become friends with her .. .. I think you friend is doing the same thing because like i said ' 'Trying to fit in ' ' Nevertheless , its stupid , although i do nt regret what i 've done .. as I only smoke on social occasions . However what your friend is doing is a little childish . I suggest you slap her , tell her to grow the heck up ..

Seems like it makes you worry unduly about her , so she 's achieved something . Sad fact is , it 's very unlikely she 'll come back to how she was through your input .
