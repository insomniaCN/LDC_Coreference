Judge allows Mee to give interviews 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
LARGO — A judge on Friday refused to stop ' 'Hiccup Girl’' Jennifer Mee from giving interviews to the media in the final days before her murder trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
Pinellas - Pasco Circuit Judge Nancy Moate Ley also refused an unusual request to allow the Dr. Phil show to have a cellphone - sized video camera in the courtroom to interview Mee during breaks in her trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
Next week ’s trial of Mee is expected to attract widespread media attention . Mee and her attorney , John Trevena , scheduled interviews in the Pinellas County jail with the Today show , Dr. Phil , Inside Edition , Bay News 9 and the Tampa Bay Times .
< / P> 
<P> 
But prosecutors objected in a motion filed Wednesday , saying the media blitz ' ' could make it difficult to select an impartial jury . '' It also said potential jurors could be exposed to ' ' irrelevant and inadmissible statements ’ ' designed to ' ' elicit sympathy for the defendant . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Ley said she believed impartial jurors can be found .
< / P> 
<P> 
After the hearing , the Sheriff ’s Office and Trevena scheduled the media interviews for Monday morning , but that did n’t end the controversy .
< / P> 
<P> 
Prosecutors said they would send a homicide detective to sit in on the interviews , with a video camera , in case Mee says something incriminating . Trevena objects , saying ' ' that ’s pure intimidation . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Trevena has said Mee wants to do the interviews and has a First Amendment right to do so .
< / P> 
<P> 
Jurors typically are asked whether they have read news coverage of cases to ensure they have n’t decided someone ’s guilt before a trial begins .
< / P> 
<P> 
Also Friday , Trevena said the Dr. Phil show was interested in providing a small video camera to interview Mee during breaks in the trial . He said the footage would be aired at some point after the trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
Trevena explained later that a member of the legal team could have interviewed Mee during courtroom breaks . This camera would have been in addition to the usual news cameras expected to be used by photographers throughout the trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'If your question to me is , 'Judge Ley , can we have Dr. Phil ’s little camera or recorder in the courtroom for breaks in the trial …’ my answer is no thank you , '' Ley said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Diane Dimond , a reporter who specializes in covering criminal justice issues , said in an interview she had never heard of a lawyer carrying a camera for a TV show .
< / P> 
<P> 
Dimond said Joe Amendola , attorney for convicted child molester and retired Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky , arranged a pretrial interview with NBC sports anchor Bob Costas and facilitated an audio interview aired on Penn State radio platforms before his sentencing .
< / P> 
<P> 
Both interviews , intended to humanize Sandusky and present his perspective , were used as evidence against him , Dimond said . ' 'My warning to the lawyer is : The hand that feeds can also bite you , '' she said .

One of the other people accused in the St. Petersburg murder was convicted last month in a trial that received scant publicity . Laron Cordale Raiford , 23 , was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole . The third defendant , Lamont Antonio Newton , 25 , will go on trial after Mee .
< / P> 
<P> 
St. Petersburg police said the trio plotted to rob Shannon Griffin , 22 . He was found shot to death at a vacant home just north of downtown .
< / P> 
<P> 
Under Florida law , someone can be convicted of murder if he or she commits a serious felony , such as robbery , and someone is killed . That ’s what happened here , prosecutors say .
