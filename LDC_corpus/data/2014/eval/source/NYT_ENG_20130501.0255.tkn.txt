COURT PAPERS OFFER DETAILS IN TERROR CASE

The terrorism case landed on the public docket in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn last year like a riddle . Prosecutors charged three foreign men arrested overseas with supporting a Somali terrorist group . They did not reveal details of the allegations against the men , their nationalities or even their connections to the United States .

<P> 
Then on Wednesday , some details finally emerged in government documents , though much about the case remains to be seen .

The court documents offer a glimpse of the government ’s rationale for bringing suspects accused of being foreign terrorists into the federal court system – something that has happened with greater frequency in the past few months , even as the approach has been criticized for not having clearly defined limits .

<P> 
The men , prosecutors said , participated in attacks against Americans by consorting with others whom the U.S. government believes to be terrorists . These kinds of charges , called material support of terrorism charges , are allowed under the United States ’ broad terrorism laws , which allow prosecution of those suspects believed to have associated with accused terrorists .

Some personal information also emerged about them : Madhi Hashi is a British citizen , and Mohamed Yusuf is a Swedish citizen . The nationality of the third man , Ali Yasin Ahmed , was not revealed , but he was assisted by Swedish counsel at a previous hearing . A defense lawyer for Yusuf , Ephraim Savitt , said that the men were freedom fighters in a cause that had nothing to do with the United States and that the men would offer that defense at trial .

All three , who were arrested in Africa while traveling to Yemen , have pleaded not guilty .

Prosecutors say they traveled to Somalia to join to al - Shabab , a U.S. - designated terrorist group linked to al - Qaida . In addition , the documents charge that the men were connected to two U.S. citizens from Minnesota ’s Somali community , Shirwa Ahmed and Farah Mohamed Beledi , suicide bombers who died in recent years in Somalia .

<P> 
In October 2008 , Swedish authorities intercepted phone calls between Ali Yasin Ahmed and Yusuf , in which the men discussed their plans to travel to Somalia to join al - Shabab and die as martyrs , according to the documents . The conversation came after suicide bombings in two Somali cities targeting the government there , and the two men discussed the attacks . After an attack in Mogadishu in 2009 , Ali Yasin Ahmed said during an intercepted phone call that he was an associate of the suicide bomber responsible for that bombing .

<P> 
Prosecutors then also pointed to the men ’s suicide bomber training in 2011 in Somalia and association with Beledi , who prosecutors said bombed a government checkpoint in Mogadishu that year .

<P> 
None of the bombings – in Somalia , Burundi and Uganda – targeted American locations , according to court documents ; however , one American was killed in Burundi and several more were injured .
