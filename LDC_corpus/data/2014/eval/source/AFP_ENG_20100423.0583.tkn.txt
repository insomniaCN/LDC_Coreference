China said Friday it had urged monks who travelled to its earthquake disaster 
zone to aid rescue efforts to return to their monasteries to avoid getting in 
the way of official relief operations .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The duties of rescue workers in the quake zone are basically over , and the 
focus has moved to disease prevention and reconstruction , which need specialised 
people , " the government said a statement .
< / P> 
<P> 
" While fully recognising the positive contributions of the monks that came from 
other areas , we suggested to them that they return to their monasteries to 
ensure the high effectiveness and order of quake relief work , " it said in a 
statement issued by the State Council , or cabinet .
< / P> 
<P> 
Activists had said that monks who had travelled to the remote Yushu region of 
northwestern province of Qinghai to help with rescue and relief efforts after 
the killer 6.9 - magnitude quake had been told to leave .

Tibetan Buddhist monks played a key role in the response to last week 's quake 
high up on the Tibetan plateau that killed at least 2,187 people , including over 
200 schoolchildren , and left another 80 missing .
< / P> 
<P> 
These efforts have been largely passed over in state media reports , which have 
focused on the government response , but the State Council said it recognised the 
contributions made by monks .
< / P> 
<P> 
" After the quake , monks in Yushu rapidly took part in rescue efforts along with 
other people , religious groups continuously donated money and aid , and continued 
to organise religious activities such as prayers , and played a positive role , " 
the statement said .
< / P> 
<P> 
The region 's lamas and monks remain a point of concern for Beijing following 
bloody anti-Chinese unrest across the region in 2008 that stemmed from initial 
peaceful protests by monks in the Tibetan capital Lhasa .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The government 's attitude is that the Lamas are an unstable element , this is 
especially so following the unrest , " Woeser , a leading Tibetan blogger and 
activist , told AFP .
< / P> 
<P> 
She said monks had been told to leave as " they had already done too much and 
that if they stayed it could become troublesome . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
However , since shortly after the quake struck , authorities had repeatedly 
advised all well - meaning civilians not to flood into the area which lies at an 
altitude of 4,000 metres ( 13,200 feet ) , saying it could hinder relief efforts .
