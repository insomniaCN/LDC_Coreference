GEORGIA PROMISES NEW LOOK AT A CIA OFFICER ’ S DEATH 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
STRASBOURG , France – The government of Georgia is taking a new look at one of the mysteries left over from the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union : the shooting death of a CIA officer , Freddie Woodruff , outside the Georgian capital , Tbilisi , 20 years ago .

<P> 
“ The case has not been properly investigated , ” Justice Minister Tea Tsulukiani said , referring to the failure of previous governments to present a plausible explanation for the killing , which took place on Aug . 8 , 1993 .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ We have some serious doubts about what really happened , ” she added in an interview during a visit to the Strasbourg - based Council of Europe along with Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili , who took office after parliamentary elections in October .

<P> 
Michael Pullara , a Houston - based lawyer who has studied the Woodruff murder case and lobbied for years for a new investigation , said he was delighted by Georgia ’s apparent readiness to re-examine the murky saga .
< / P> 
<P> 
Georgia attributed Woodruff ’s death to a random shot fired by a drunken Georgian , a former Soviet soldier . Anzor Sharmaidze was swiftly convicted of murder in 1994 and sentenced to 15 years in prison , a term later extended to 18 1 / 2 years . He was released from jail in 2008 after witnesses recanted their testimony and said they had been tortured into implicating him .

<P> 
Tsulukiani said she had not examined the file closely . But she believes Sharmaidze was jailed only because “ they badly needed to find someone ” to take the blame for a killing that severely embarrassed Georgia ’s leader at the time , Eduard A . Shevardnadze .
< / P> 
<P> 
Georgia ’s justice system has long been tainted by political meddling , and a primary purpose of Ivanishvili ’s visit to Strasbourg last week was to assure European officials and legislators that his new government was committed to the rule of law . His political opponents , notably Mikhail Saakashvili , the country ’s pro-American president , accuse him of using the judiciary to settle political scores .
< / P> 
<P> 
Pullara said in a telephone interview that getting to the bottom of Woodruff ’s death “ is a litmus test of the new government ’s commitment to justice . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Though released from jail , Sharmaidze has not been formally cleared of murder .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ His life has been destroyed , ” Pullara said . He described him as a victim of a “ cruel compromise for reasons of expediency ” – a fall guy who satisfied both Washington ’s desire for a culprit and Moscow ’s desire that Russia be kept distant from any hint of involvement in the murder .
