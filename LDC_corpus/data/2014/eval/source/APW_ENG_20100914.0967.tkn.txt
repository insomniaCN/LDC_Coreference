Kid Rock and his entourage were trying to defend themselves from another customer at a suburban Atlanta Waffle House when a fight broke out in 2007 , said a lawyer for the musician who was in court Tuesday .

<P> 
The entertainer , whose real name is Robert James Ritchie , and five people who were with him that night are being sued over the fight . Harlen Akins claims the group beat him for no reason and is seeking unspecified punitive damages and $ 6,000 in medical fees , according to his lawyer .

<P> 
The entertainer and his party behaved " like a pack of wild animals , " starting a fight inside the restaurant and pursuing Akins into the parking lot to beat him up before leaving in their tour bus , Akins' lawyer Eric Hertz said in his opening statement in a DeKalb County court .
< / P> 
<P> 
Akins demonstrated " a pattern of provocation and escalation , " while Kid Rock and his party consistently tried to defuse the situation , said William Horton , a lawyer for Kid Rock and five others being sued .

<P> 
Akins arrived at the restaurant alone shortly after 5 a.m. local time on Oct . 21 , 2007 . Kid Rock , who had given a concert in Atlanta earlier , arrived in his tour bus around the same time .
< / P> 
<P> 
Akins and two women in Kid Rock 's party , one of whom he had known for years , began talking . Kid Rock was either jealous that Akins was getting the attention or was insulted by what Akins was saying to the women , but either way , a physical attack was unjustified , Hertz said .

<P> 
Horton countered that Akins got into an argument with the women and with Kid Rock , who tried to calm things down by offering to buy Akins' breakfast . It was Akins who kept trying to provoke an argument , Horton said .

<P> 
As witness testimony got under way , the jury saw parts of a Waffle House surveillance video of the fight . The video shows the parties fighting , but there is no sound so jurors could n't hear what was being said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Kid Rock pleaded guilty in March 2008 to a misdemeanor charge of simple battery in the fight .
< / P> 
<P> 
The civil trial is expected to wrap up Wednesday or Thursday , Judge Johnny Panos said .
