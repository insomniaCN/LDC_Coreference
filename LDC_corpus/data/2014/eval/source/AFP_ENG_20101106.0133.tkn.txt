Somali pirates said Saturday they had received a record nine - million - dollar 
ransom in a helicopter air drop for the release of a South Korean supertanker , 
Samho Dream , with 24 crew .

<P> 
" The boat was freed this morning after the payment of nine million dollars to my 
colleagues , " one of the pirates told AFP by telephone .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The money was dropped by helicopter and they ( the pirates ) are in the process 
of sharing it , " Abdi Yare said from the port of Hobyo .

<P> 
Other sources in Hobyo , which has become the main lair of pirates preying on 
merchant ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean , confirmed the sum paid , 
which equals or exceeds the largest ransoms paid previously .

The 300,0000 tonne Samho Dream was seized in the Indian Ocean in April as it was 
heading fully laden from Iraq to Louisiana in the United States with a crew of 
19 Filipinos and five South Koreans .

Heavily armed pirates using speedboats operating from lawless Somalia have been 
attacking ships over a vast area despite the presence of foreign naval forces 
for several years .

<P> 
They sometimes hold vessels for weeks before releasing them for large ransoms 
paid by governments or shipowners .

<P> 
The biggest sums paid previously were also for the release of supertankers .

Between three and eight million dollars were paid to free the Sirius Star in 
January 2009 , and between 5.5 million and nine million for the Maran Centaurus a 
year later , according to sources .
