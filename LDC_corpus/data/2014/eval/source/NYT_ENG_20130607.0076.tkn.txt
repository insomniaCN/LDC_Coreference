Convicted killer stabbed to death 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
Katherine Seeber , a Wilton woman who was paroled 10 months ago after spending a dozen years in prison for the killing of her step - great - grandmother , was fatally stabbed in Queens , New York City police said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Seeber ’s boyfriend , Pedro Sanchez , was charged with second - degree murder Wednesday for the killing , said Detective Martin Tinspeechley . It ’s the same charge Seeber pleaded guilty to in 2000 for her role in the death of 91 - year - old Ruth Witter in a robbery gone awry .
< / P> 
<P> 
Both the attorney who defended Seeber for more than a decade and the prosecutor who sought to put her behind bars said Seeber ’s death appears to be the final chapter in a life that all too often centered around abusive relationships .
< / P> 
<P> 
The criminal case against Seeber was one of the lengthiest and most unusual legal sagas Saratoga County has ever seen .
< / P> 
<P> 
Allegations surfaced that a veteran police investigator who committed suicide had mishandled evidence , a retrial was ordered and the case ultimately ended with a rarely used plea deal .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'It was probably one of the most complex cases we ’ve seen , procedurally , '' said Saratoga County District Attorney James A . Murphy III , who took over as district attorney the year before Witter was killed . Murphy said prosecutors in Queens called him about Seeber ’s death late Wednesday night .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'It ’s sad , especially in her context , but I ca n’t say I was surprised , '' Murphy said . ' 'She was very troubled her whole life . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
New York City police could not say what led to Seeber ’s death . She was found dead in her 55th Street home in Astoria Tuesday evening .
< / P> 
<P> 
Police said Seeber had only known Sanchez a few months .
< / P> 
<P> 
The New York Daily News reported Sanchez confronted Seeber , 32 , about her seeing another man and then stabbed her in the torso and face with a kitchen knife .
< / P> 
<P> 
Both the Daily News and the New York Post reported Sanchez tried to clean up the scene after killing Seeber . In addition to murder , Sanchez was also charged with criminal possession of a weapon , evidence tampering and resisting arrest .
< / P> 
<P> 
The parole program that oversaw Seeber ’s release helped her find housing in Queens . John Cuilla , the recently retired Saratoga County public defender who represented Seeber since 2000 , said Seeber planned on moving to Washington to live with her brother .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'It ’s a tragic ending , '' Cuilla said . ' 'It appears that she just could not get out of that cycle of domestic violence . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Seeber was raised in Rexburg , Idaho , a predominantly Mormon city of 17,000 on the eastern edge of the state . There , Cuilla said , Seeber ’s parents ’ troubled marriage first exposed her to domestic violence .
< / P> 
<P> 
A once - promising student who aspired to a career in the military , Seeber moved to the Capital Region in 1998 . Both prosecutors and Cuilla say Seeber , whose family said she never smoked or drank as a teenager out west , quickly fell in with the wrong crowd . She started dating Jeffrey Hampshire . The teenage couple spent most of their time partying .
< / P> 
<P> 
During one binge in February 2000 , Seeber and Hampshire went to Witter ’s Mordella Road home in Colonie looking for items to steal and pawn for cash for a hotel party .
< / P> 
<P> 
A struggle ensued . Witter was strangled with an electrical cord .
< / P> 
<P> 
The nonagenarian ’s frozen body was found in a snowy ditch in Stillwater , her ankles and feet bound with tape , a gag in her mouth .
< / P> 
<P> 
Though she was killed in Colonie , the case ended up in Murphy ’s hands because the couple crossed into Saratoga County to dispose of the body .
< / P> 
<P> 
After prosecutors said Seeber unknowingly led detectives to Witter ’s body , both Seeber , then 18 , and Hampshire , then 19 , were charged with murder .
< / P> 
<P> 
Seeber pleaded guilty . Hampshire went to trial and was acquitted . Hampshire , however , was already facing an unrelated burglary charge and would later be arrested for multiple felonies , including helping cover up a fatal hit - and - run crash .
< / P> 
<P> 
Seeber first unsuccessfully appealed her murder plea in 2004 on the grounds that she was not in the house to commit another crime , a prerequisite for the murder charge . Then , in 2011 , Seeber appealed again when it was found that Gary Veeder , a veteran State Police forensic scientist , had processed some of the evidence in her case . Veeder committed suicide in 2008 after State Police pressed him about his mishandling of dozens of cases .
< / P> 
<P> 
Seeber ’s conviction was overturned and a new trial was ordered . Seeber , however , pleaded guilty to manslaughter and burglary under the rarely used Alford plea , which allows a defendant to maintain his or her innocence but admit that prosecutors likely could have proven criminal charges at trial . Seeber was sentenced to 141 / 2 years in prison in May 2012 , but was released later that July because of time served .
< / P> 
<P> 
At her May 2012 sentencing , Seeber repeatedly apologized to Witter ’s family and invoked religion , saying her life had been turned around and that she wanted to work with domestic violence victims after living through a lifetime of volatile relationships .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'I offer this to you not as an excuse , '' Seeber told Witter ’s relatives at her sentencing . ' 'But as an explanation to all your questions for all these years . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Both Murphy and Cuilla said that Seeber had changed since Witter ’s killing .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'In 2000 , she was a naive little 18 - year - old girl who lived through domestic violence her whole life , '' Cuilla said . He said he was dismayed that it appeared she had recently fallen into another abusive relationship with Sanchez . ' 'I thought she was ready to come out and be a productive member of society . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Detectives who questioned Seeber in 2000 described her as unremorseful , cold and tough . Hampshire ’s lawyers portrayed Seeber as the mastermind behind Witter ’s killing . In 2005 , Hampshire ’s then attorney , Cheryl Coleman , described Seeber as ' ' the single most frightening sociopath I have ever met . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Murphy noted that not all victims of domestic violence end up as violent offenders themselves . He also said he and Witter ’s family still view Seeber as a killer .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'Ruth was a very elderly woman who was having her great granddaughter and a friend over for a visit , not to be robbed and killed , '' Murphy said . '' ( Witter ’s family ) looked upon her as a cold and calculated person who manipulated her great grandmother to try and steal jewelry and money , and if she had to sacrifice ( Witter ’s ) life to get those things that was how it was going to go .
