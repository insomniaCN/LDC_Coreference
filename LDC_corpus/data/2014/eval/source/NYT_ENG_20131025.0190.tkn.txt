BLACK WIDOW'S 1985 WEB OF LIES UNRAVELS 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
It was supposed to be the work of a barefoot man who snuck into a Houston couple ’s home in 1985 , raped a woman , killed a man and disappeared into the night .
< / P> 
<P> 
In reality , it was a wife who shot her seventh husband as he slept , then went on for 28 years living a lie .
< / P> 
<P> 
Carolyn Sue Krizan - Wilson , 71 , admitted Wednesday in a Harris County courtroom that she shot Roy McCaleb , her husband of two years , almost three decades ago .
< / P> 
<P> 
In exchange for the plea , Krizan - Wilson was sentenced to six months in jail , to be followed by 10 years of deferred adjudication , a form of probation that means she will not have a conviction on her record if successfully completed .
< / P> 
<P> 
The victim ’s family , who signed off on the deal , lost their composure after the plea .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'She said 'I did it , ' and that ’s what we really wanted to hear , '' said Linda Petty , McCaleb ’s sister , with tears in her eyes .
< / P> 
<P> 
Krizan - Wilson will begin her six months in jail on Dec . 26 , the day after Christmas .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'It is unfair that she gets to start serving her sentence after the holidays , '' McCaleb ’s daughter , Pam Nalley , wrote in her statement to the court . ' 'How many holidays has she taken from us ? ' ' 
< / P> 
<P> 
McCaleb , a construction foreman , had just turned 51 when he was killed on Sept . 22 , 1985 . Krizan - Wilson was 43 .
< / P> 
<P> 
In speaking to reporters after the killing , Krizan - Wilson told a fantastic story about being carjacked and raped 10 days before the shooting by a barefoot man with a knife . It was a crime that she did not report until after her husband ’s death .
< / P> 
<P> 
She said the rapist returned and was able to walk into the couple ’s North Shore home through an unlocked door on a Sunday night .
< / P> 
<P> 
She claimed the man again held a knife to her throat and assaulted her . Then he took the gun she kept under her pillow , went to where McCaleb was sleeping and shot him , she said .
< / P> 
<P> 
As the man fled , she said , the two collided , and the intruder dropped the gun . She picked it up and fired two shots after him .
< / P> 
<P> 
Days without a suspect or any new leads stretched into months and years .
< / P> 
<P> 
Nalley said she called the Houston Police Department and the District Attorney ’s Office at least once a year for updates .
< / P> 
<P> 
Her tenacity paid off five years ago when two Texas Rangers agreed to look at the case , and then - District Attorney Ken Magidson decided to prosecute .
< / P> 
<P> 
She worked for HPD 
< / P> 
<P> 
In 2008 , police arrested the widow , who had been a civilian employee at the Houston Police Department as her two sons climbed the ranks as police officers .
< / P> 
<P> 
Prosecutors said the evidence had not changed in the nearly three decades since the killing , but the fresh perspective turned it into a case they believed they could win .
< / P> 
<P> 
Assistant Harris County District Attorney Bill Exley said the lack of new evidence , and because it was important to the victim ’s family that Krizan - Wilson admit to murder , meant the plea deal was the right compromise .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'I agree that six months might seem like a light sentence for an intentional killing , but keep in mind that she might not have ever done a day in jail to begin with , '' he said . ' 'She ’s going in and going to serve day for day . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
James Stafford , an attorney for Krizan - Wilson , said the septuagenarian is suffering from dementia and a host of other health issues and wanted to get past the case against her .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'I think this is closure for both sides of the family , '' Stafford said . ' 'Given her age and medical condition , I think all sides realized this was the just and right decision to make for all of the parties . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
After her 2008 arrest , Krizan - Wilson ’s attorneys argued that too much time had passed to indict her , a position that swayed former state District Judge Kevin Fine . He 
< / P> 
<P> 
dismissed the case , and for five years , it wound its way through the appellate courts . That dismissal was reversed and sent back to the original court .
< / P> 
<P> 
Poignant statement 
< / P> 
<P> 
It was a saga that Nalley talked about in the victim ’s impact statement she wrote to dress down the killer after the plea .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'Carol , you deserved a much longer and harsher sentence , '' Nalley wrote in the statement .
< / P> 
<P> 
Her daughter had to read the statement in court when Nalley found herself too distraught to address Krizan - Wilson . ' 'We ’ve been failed by the system here on Earth , but one day soon you will be in God ’s hands , and he will decide your just punishment for murdering my father . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Krizan - Wilson appeared stoic as she listened to the words .
< / P> 
<P> 
Nalley said she believes her father was killed for an insurance policy Krizan - Wilson took out months before the shooting . However , she said , the policy was never paid because of suspicions about the death .
< / P> 
<P> 
Nalley said her father was Krizan - Wilson ’s seventh husband and that her former stepmother remarried after the slaying . Stafford said Krizan - Wilson and her most recent husband divorced in 1990 .
< / P> 
<P> 
Krizan - Wilson was charged with bigamy in 1986 , but the case was dismissed .
< / P> 
<P> 
Records showed Krizan - Wilson ’s 1976 marriage to Melvin Laxson , whom she divorced in 1987 , overlapped with her marriage to McCaleb .
< / P> 
<P> 
Krizan - Wilson did not answer questions from reporters waiting outside the courtroom Wednesday . Instead , she walked out a back door in state District Judge Ryan Patrick ’s court and disappeared . XXX - End of Story & lt ; 3D & gt ;
