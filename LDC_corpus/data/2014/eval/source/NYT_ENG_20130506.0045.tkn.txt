< / HEADLINE>

<P> 
BOSTON – As the body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev , one of the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings , lay in a Worcester , Mass . , funeral home for a fourth day , Gov. Deval Patrick said Monday that it was up to the family , not the state , to resolve where the burial would take place .

<P> 
“ First of all , this is n’t a state or a federal issue – it ’s the family ’s issue , ” he told reporters in New Bedford , Mass . “ And the family has some options . I assume they will make a decision soon . I hope they do . ”

Patrick declined to answer when asked if he would oppose Tsarnaev ’s burial in Massachusetts . But Rep. Edward J . Markey , the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat that John Kerry vacated when he became secretary of state , said he would oppose such a burial .

“ I think that the body should be controlled by the federal government , ” Markey said . “ But if the people of Massachusetts do not want that terrorist to be buried on our soil , then it should not be . ”

No cemetery has offered space for Tsarnaev , who with his younger brother has been accused of planning and carrying out the bombings , which killed three people and injured more than 260 others on April 15 . His brother , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , 19 , has been charged with the bombings and is being held in a federal medical detention facility outside Boston .

Federal officials said they had no jurisdiction or interest in getting involved in the burial controversy . An FBI official said that the body was no longer needed in the investigation and that the burial was up to the family and the local authorities .

As the stalemate continued , one of three men facing charges related to the bombings was released from federal custody .

At a detention hearing Monday afternoon , Robel K . Phillipos , a former college student who is accused of lying to investigators , was released to his mother ’s custody while he awaits trial .

<P> 
In a joint motion , lawyers for the defense and prosecution asked Magistrate Judge Marianne B . Bowler of U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to release Phillipos , 19 , on $ 100,000 bail on the condition that he stay under house arrest and wear an electronic tracking bracelet . Bail was to be secured with real estate put up by a third party ; the address where he is to be held under house arrest will not be made public .
