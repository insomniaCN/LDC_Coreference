ATLANTA - The state of Alabama posthumously pardoned three black men Thursday who had been falsely convicted more than 80 years ago in the rapes of two white women , absolving the last of the so - called Scottsboro Boys .
< / P> 
<P> 
During a hearing in Montgomery , the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles voted unanimously to issue pardons to the three men , Haywood Patterson , Charles Weems and James A . Wright , all of whom were convicted of rape in the 1930s .

<P> 
The case , which yielded two landmark Supreme Court rulings about the inclusion of blacks on juries and the need for adequate legal representation , had continued to hang over Alabama as an enduring mark of its tainted , segregationist past . The last of the men died in 1989 .

“ We ’re certainly a different state in the 21st century than we were , ” state Sen. Arthur Orr , a sponsor of the legislation that led to the pardons , said in a telephone interview . “ Today is the final chapter - and it ends on a brighter note - of a very tragic chapter in our history . ”

The men were among a group of nine first tried in April 1931 for rape after a fight aboard a train passing through Jackson County , in northeast Alabama . Within three weeks of the fight , an Alabama judge had sentenced eight of the men to death after their convictions by all - white juries .

<P> 
The U.S. Supreme Court intervened the next year and overturned the convictions , setting off a long stretch of additional trials and appeals .
< / P> 
<P> 
Prosecutors dropped the rape charges against five of the men in July 1937 , but four others - including the three pardoned Thursday - were convicted again and sentenced to lengthy prison terms or death .

State officials ultimately approved paroles for three of them , including Clarence Norris , who received a pardon from Gov. George Wallace in 1976 . Patterson , though , escaped from prison and ultimately died in Michigan .
< / P> 
<P> 
Nudged by researchers , the state Legislature earlier this year unanimously supported a measure from Orr and others that allowed the pardons board to act on cases that had not been overturned by the courts or abandoned by prosecutors .

“ We can not take back what happened , ” Gov. Robert Bentley said in April when he signed the legislation . “ But we can make it right moving forward . ”
