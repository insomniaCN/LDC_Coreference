WASHINGTON - Former White House aide I . Lewis " Scooter " Libby was sentenced to 2 1 / 2 years in prison Tuesday for lying and obstructing the 
CIA leak investigation .

Libby , the former chief of staff to Vice President 
Dick Cheney , stood calmly before a packed courtroom as a federal judge said the evidence overwhelmingly proved his guilt and left the courthouse without commenting .

" People who occupy these types of positions , where they have the welfare and security of nation in their hands , have a special obligation to not do anything that might create a problem , " U.S. District Judge Reggie B . Walton said .

Walton did not set a date for Libby to report to prison . Though he saw no reason to let Libby remain free pending appeal , Walton said he would accept written arguments on the issue and rule later .

Deputy White House press secretary Dana Perino , accompanying 
President Bush on Air Force One from the Czech Republic to Germany Tuesday , told reporters that Bush " felt terrible for the family , especially for his wife and kids . " 

She said Bush would comment no further on the case at this time .

Looks like Scooter will serve some time . The judge is not likely to grant bond while an appeal is filed .

There is a lot of scuttlebutt in my local rag about Bush possibly pardoning him . To do so , IMO would be a travesty .

Well I feel sorry for his wife and kids too but if you do the crime you should pay the time . I hope President Bush does not give him a pardon .

Scooter got his knickers twisted because he arrogantly thought he and his ilk were above the law .

I am sure that there are many men in jails with wives , kids , sick mothers and lonely pets . That is not a reason for absolving a person from taking his just punishment .

Phoenix32890 I am slightly confused on your post . You quoted me and I am not quite sure why since I feel there should not be a pardon .

That certainly is n't a reason in Scooter 's case , but I disagree that it 's never the case .

I served on a jury in which an illegal from Mexico chose to drink 21 beers and then go for a drive ( on the wrong side of the road ) resulting in a head - on collision which in turn changed the lives of the family in the other car forever ( grandmother blinded , 2 - year old 's chest crushed ) . The prosecutors wanted to throw the book at him , but we gave him probation because he had a wife and 3 teenagers to support ( with the provision that if he was caught driving drunk again he 'd serve out his 10 - year prison sentence , period ) .

Bush has to pardon him . You all can continue to think with your emotions but this is n't a right / wrong issue . It 's a political issue . Bush had to pardon him or risk his other allies turning on him for fear their butt is n't covered .

In most states , the court holds a sentencing hearing for felony convictions and convictions that can lead to incarceration . This hearing is usually held several days or weeks after delivery of the verdict and can consist of oral testimony , cross-examination of witnesses , evidence , and arguments to the sentencing authority ( either the judge or the jury ) .

a / t some commentators libby will likely be able to stay out of jail for " a while " - several months ? he might serve a very short jail sentence and receive a pardon towards the end of president bush ' term .
all guesswork , of course .

If Walton denies him bond , then he 'll report in 45 - 60 days .

If he allows Libby to stay out of jail while he appeals ... it will be a true travesty . But it could take several months .

I still hope President Bush does not give a pardon .

I realize it is a political issue . What is to be gained by a pardon if the President will soon be out of office ?
