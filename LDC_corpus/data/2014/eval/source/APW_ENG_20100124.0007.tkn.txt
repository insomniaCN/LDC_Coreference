President Barack Obama phoned Senate allies Saturday as two key senators predicted that embattled Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will be confirmed for a second term .
< / P> 
<P> 
Obama made calls from the White House to members of the Senate leadership and others and was assured Bernanke would win confirmation , a senior White House official told The Associated Press . The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private phone calls .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Senate is scheduled to vote on the Bernanke confirmation by the end of this coming week , said Jim Manley , spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid .
< / P> 
<P> 
Meanwhile , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd , a Democrat , and former Senate Budget Committee Chairman Judd Gregg , a Republican , said in a statement Saturday that Bernanke is the right person to help guide the economy back from the worst recession since the 1930s .
< / P> 
<P> 
Two other Democrats who had remained quiet about their intentions , Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts , and the No. 2 Senate Democrat , Dick Durbin of Illinois , said Saturday that they will support him . Bernanke should not be the scapegoat for systemic failings , Kerry said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Bernanke 's term expires Jan . 31 .
< / P> 
<P> 
Already four Senate Democrats have said they would vote against the Fed chairman .
< / P> 
<P> 
Bernanke has become the focus of increased criticism since Republican Scott Brown won a Senate seat in an upset election in Massachusetts this past week .
< / P> 
<P> 
Dodd and Gregg -- neither seeking re-election in November -- said that " based on our discussions with our colleagues , we are very confident " that Bernanke will win confirmation by the Senate for another term .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Bernanke has done an excellent job responding to one of the most significant financial crises our country has ever encountered , " the two senators said . " We support his nomination because he is the right leader to guide the Federal Reserve in this recovering economy . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
The Fed chief 's supporters need 60 votes to prevent opponents from blocking confirmation . Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent liberal from Vermont , and Republican senators Jim Bunning of Kentucky , Jim DeMint of South Carolina and David Vitter of Louisiana are spearheading a campaign to block Bernanke 's confirmation .
< / P> 
<P> 
Bernanke is widely credited with helping to prevent the Great Recession from turning into a second Great Depression . But his support of Wall Street bailouts has angered Americans who are struggling with double - digit unemployment and soaring home foreclosures .
< / P> 
<P> 
On Friday , White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel phoned senators urging support of Bernanke . Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner also made calls to lawmakers , officials said .
