Hi , This is what you get for speeding . A spanking . Police sued over alleged paddling of teen for speeding ticket . I think the police went overboard with the spanking of this 16 year old . What do you think of this ?

I would like to see a little background on the cop and the boy . The story seems strangly one sided . It seems like the whole thing is fdrom Mommy 's POV . I think she may have just seen a cool opportunity to make a quick 200 grand .

On the other hand ... what kind of police dept does this place have ? I would have felt a little strange dishing out that punishment . Sounds like we have a cop who likes to spank teenaged boys .

First off a 16 year old is more adult than child .

Second , there is nothing sexual about paddling a bare bottom unless your into that sort of thing .

It was a stupid idea , from a small town cop . Ca n't say I 'm amazed , disturbed or even surprised .

Heck yeah ! 

I think it is hilarious and they should take up the policy . Most kids my age are brash and arrogant and could probably use a paddling .

Yeah , at first glance I found the idea to be quite funny . Then I read the article and the mother saying her son , no wait child , was " tramatized " .

Yeah , then they called the 16 guy a " child " . Hmm , lets see : consider myself a man , 2 year age difference , * thinks * .... 

Aha ! I have it ! The guy really is a child becuase he was " tramatized " over a paddling . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/>

What I find interesting is that the 16 year old allowed the cop to paddle him , not once , but three times .

I 'm sorry , but this is both funny and sick at the same time .

The mother probably agreed so that whatever the child had done would ' go away ' and their insurance would n't get higher .

The guy , or ' child ' , probably did n't want to pay the ticket and figured that the ' paddling ' would be like the ones his mom / dad probably gave him as a younger child . Lets face it , parents do n't enjoy spanking their kids , as it causes them pain . I know for a FACT that my mom and dad did n't give me a ' thrashing ' as a kid , but I sure did n't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father . ^.^ 

The Police is honestly probably a very sick person . Not once have I EVER heard of a cop giving the people a ' choice ' in their ticketing . He probably saw this as a way to get some of his rocks off , and took the risk . Now he 's gotten introuble for it , and I hope that if his intentions were what I think they were , he gets fired . There is no need for spanking a 16 year old , let alone even THINKING of trying to do so bare bottom . ~shakes his head~ 

If I was this kid , I would never have agreed to it . Think of the humiliation this boy is going to have have to face in school . ~sigh~. people always make things harder for themselves . Just pay the ticket and get over it .

* chuckles * Auto filter at my board changes that to ' person of illegitimate parentage ' .

I do n't know if the police wanted to do this to ' get his rocks off ' , but I do know that it was inapropriete . However , I think just about everyone went into fault here : the teenager twice ( for speeding AND for agreeing to an alternative punnishment he must have known was illegal ) , the mother for agreeing to something like this and then sueing over it , and the chief of police for making up such a sick ' program ' in the first place .

Should the mother sue to get the police chief removed : yes , of course that man should be removed . Should she get even one dollar ? NO !! She decided to agree when she heard of a program for her 16 year old son that included 15 paddling sessions ? And then there were no alarmbells going off ? 
But when he came out crying , there were ? 

I 'm sorry ... but no ... Perhaps a social worker should be assigned to them to see what parenting values there are in that family , and to give them some good advice .
