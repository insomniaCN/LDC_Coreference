Well I am now married ... I got married last week on Friday , November 5th .. I 'm grateful for this because now I have Medical Insurance , I had started a new job , waited my 3 month period , was SUPER excited about insurance , since I was getting a better insurance than my previous employer , then the insurance company said I had no insurance because I never sent a form in ... Was unreal , I could n't believe what I was hearing .. I even asked the man nicely " How can someone with Multiple Sclerosis NOT file for insurance when my medication alone cost about $ 13,000 a year . " He did n't comment .. So from there we changed our spring wedding to November , a really small wedding to get insurance for me faster . Alot of people must have been praying for me since my M . S . has n't been too bad except for when I was ill in August / September . I 'm really happy to have insurance , I can get my MRIs done , since I am in Massachusetts now I can go to UMass Hospital which has some of the best Neurologists ( My Neurologist from Connecticut told me this ) , get started on medication again .. <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/amen.gif"/> 

Today I 'm feeling ok .. My job is bothering me a bit , but I 'll get over it .. Next week I start working 6 days a week , about 50 hours .. I work for Cingular Wireless and they told me Holiday is the craziest time of the year <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/doh.gif"/> This is my first Christmas working for the company so hopefully all will go well .. . I know as soon as I get home starting next week I 'll most likely just fall <img src= " http : / / www . christianforums . com / images / smilies / sleep . gif " / > .. .. 

It 's going to be hard because I wo n't see my husband much .... I now have to work on Sundays for the next 7 weeks so I wo nt be able to go to church or see him ... My only day off will be Monday , and his Wednesday . Just have to keep alot of prayer <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/prayer.gif"/>, and keep rejoicing <img src= " http : / / www . christianforums . com / images / smilies / clap . gif " / > ...

Well it 's Saturday !!! Here at work until 7 .... Snow is everywhere , snowed yeserday until this morning , got a good 4 inches !!! I ca n't believe it .. It 's almost 2005 already , where has time gone .. . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/wave.gif"/> 

I 'm looking foward to warm weather already and I have to wait about 5 months to see it !! lol .. <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/> 

The Lord protected me this morning ... I was driving to work , and hit the brakes too much instead of downshifting and lowering my RPMs , and spun out , I did n't hit anyone thankfully just went into a driveway ... PHEW <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/prayer.gif"/> What a blessing that was since it 's a busy road .

Hallelujah , Hallelujah May everything about me be Hallelujah to my King . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/amen.gif"/> - Lyrics from Sarah Kelly .

Well it 's another Sunday and I 'm here at work again ! Only 5 more Sundays and I 'm back to having my Sunday - Monday days off again . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/amen.gif"/> 

It 's been a crazy week so far , my husband and I are thinking about leaving the crazy weather of Northeast region to move to Florida .. I know , Florida !!!! I have never even been to Florida , lol . It 's looking pretty positive right now , but he insists that he wants to buy a house , and I want an apartment .. 

He 's also going to allow me to work part time , and I can go back to college . God bless him . We told some friends last night , but I only told my auntie about this , no one in our family knows at all . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/help.gif"/> 

<img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/> I 'm very nervous / scared to live in Florida , seeing that I lived in Connecticut all my life until September of this year when I moved to Massachusetts .

His mom is probably not going to take it too well if we decide to go to Florida , she 's already pretty upset that his other 2 brother already been living in New Hampshire with their wives for sometime now , and she thought her youngest was going to stay closeby in Massachusetts . <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/sigh.gif"/> 

Florida will be different if we go ... It 's looking pretty positive of going . We just got to finish paying off his debt , and go from there ... I pray that the Lord will guide us in the right direction . If we were to go to Florida I pray the Lord directs us to a good church .
