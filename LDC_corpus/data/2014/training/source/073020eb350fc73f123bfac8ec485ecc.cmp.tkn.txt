The famous sixteen words were taken out of the SOTU address Bush gave because the intell to back it up was not there . The Bush administration put them back in .

< / quote> 

The famous 16 words were correct . The British did have evidence the Iraqis were trying to buy uranium . MI - 6 stood by that statement . So it was an accurate statement . they did n't get it , but they asked for it .

Look , guy , George Tenat went into Bush 's office and said " It 's a slam dunk , Mr. President ! " 

Joe Wilson wrote in the LA Times that no only did Saddam have WMD 's , but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he 'd use them .

This is a lot of people playing CYA when something goes wrong . If you had a real job , you see it happens every day in the business world , who ends up holding the bag of dog poop .

< / quote> 

Wow , you have totally drank the kool - aid . Next , you 're gon na tell us that Saddam was behind 9 / 11 . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Myself . Saddam was a scumbag and I 'm glad he 's dead . Are n't you ? 

< / quote> 

Not at the cost of over $ 1 Trillion and over 5,000 U.S. military deaths . HELL NO !!!! 

< / quote> 

I believe we lost that many to the days leading to D - day and at D - day . Back then it was a united country .. today is weaker because of the self righteous press of Vietnam , Korea and relive a past

The only thing that was indefensible was Clinton 's total sloth on the Bin Laden problem . If he did n't need a distraction , he did n't give a shit .

< / quote> 

This is a baseless claim , to distract from my point about Clarke .

< / quote> 

No , it 's a dead on claim . He bombed the Aspirin factory in 1998 ( which turned out to have nothing to do with Bin Laden ) the week he revealed he had been lying to us for eight months about Lewinsky . Then he never , ever mentioned it again . Then Clarke , whom NON ONE EVER HEARD OF pops out of the woodwork and says , " I told Condi about Bin Laden , and she looked at me funny " , when in fact , there are numerous taped interviews where it was clear Condi knew all about Bin Laden .

So Clarke did really nothing under Clinton , and whined that he did n't get a promotion after Bush took over .

Not even a good dodge . Answer the question - why did n't your side hold ONE Senator accountable for voting for the war on your own side ? 

< / quote> 

It 's a good response to a really ridiculous comment . You seem to be holding me personally accountable for how all Democrats voted . Are you crazy ? Desperate ? What ? 

< / quote> 

No , it 's not . I was pointing out the hypocrisy of your party colletively , not you personally . Collectively , your party nominated Kerry in 2004 because he voted for the war , and in 2006 , you did n't vote out one Senator who had voted for it . Not one . You did try to go after poor Joe Leiberman because he ignored the " War Bad Now " memo . But even managed to survive as an independent .

<quote> 
Okay , make it easy for you . Explain why I should give a shit about any of it ? 

< / quote> 

Because you understand the basic nature of the nation that you live in .

< / quote> 

I do understand it . We have one party that does the bidding of the rich , and another one that is trying to make as many of us dependent on the government as humanly possible . So it 's really a case of " choose your serfdom " .

What nation do you think we live in ?

By far the best debater and most informed candidate and could easily kick Obama 's ass in a debate ... 

Turned Clinton from a deficit spending President in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and Democrat pro-sexual harassment hero .. 

Soo .. what 's your beef with this Guy .. . ? 

< / quote> 

Okay , Lumpy , I 'm ready now . I 'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy .

Has anyone been saying anything good about him ? More specific than how smart he is ? I have n't been paying attention to the whole thread . Lotsa noise in it . But if you have , could you summarize the high points ? 

What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013 ? 

I 'm ready to listen ! <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I was kinda asking for the beefs , there 's beefs a plenty ... <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> 

I have n't read the whole thread . I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals . They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down .

I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise . They use religion as a weapon .. it just not appropriate .. 

Sorry I ca n't summarize the high points ... Sharks & amp ; NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes ..
