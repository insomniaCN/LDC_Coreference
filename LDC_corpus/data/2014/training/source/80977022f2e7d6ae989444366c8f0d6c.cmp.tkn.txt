It went wrong the day he was born .

< / quote> 

Not for the one million Texans who got the jobs Perry helped recruit .

As a Texan , I 'm glad we 're getting him back .

As an American , I regret the nation will not be using his great talents at putting people back to work .

Rick Perry is a great American man . He makes our state a pretty good place to work , but the voters in key states decided against his ability to provide jobs on account of listening to news sources with petty critiques against him .

I think that there will be people who will declare the TEA Party dead .

It is dead . Thank God . The pendulum had swung way too far into the Twilight Zone .

I do n't think so . The thing is , the TEA Movement has n't really been around long enough to establish solid leaders . It took 16 years between Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan for the modern conservative movement to take hold .

< / quote> 

Horrible analogy . You forget Goldwater actually won the nomination .

<quote orig_author= " JoeB131 " > 
After Romney loses , Perry might well be able to take another shot at it . But he should take his time and spend more time introducing himself to the American public .

Perry 's problem is that he sounds too much like Bush .

You know what . I wo n't call anyone of these candidates a joke or a flake . They 've all had very respectable careers .

And I 'm sorry . Running as a Republican candidate means you get the shit kicked out of you , your family , your friends and your kindergarten teacher and your dog by the left wing media arm of the White House on a day to day basis .

It takes balls to run . Kudos to Perry for trying .

< / quote> 

So much for the conservative mantra of personal responsibility .  

Rightists are the biggest whiners  blame everyone but oneself .

Perrys failure was his own alone , having nothing to do with the mythical liberal media . 

From the onset . It was clear he was n't serious about being president . Serious meaning that he did n't take the time to prepare for the race .

< / quote> 

He was a little busy recovering from back surgery , geaux , and he went into the race too soon after surgery . He simply was n't himself . Coaches make their athletes take off a year sometimes , depending on the surgery and the amount of time they can take a 16 - year - old high school player to a 35 - year - old professional ballhandler back on the field . Campaigns are rigorous , and Perry is I think at least 50 . I 'm sure he had the best of care , but I think I 've heard some surgery anesthetics become residual and might slow people down mentally and physically . He had to have the surgery , and it was at the worst time . He 's usually not one to get mixed up mid-sentence and has always been a good speaker .

Even so , it will be good to have our governor Rick Perry back . The Perrys are real nice people . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

point was , Goldwater lost the election . And the immediate response was to renominate Nixon the next cycle .

I hear people say that the TEA Movement goes too far and such . I still have yet to see anyone really tell me where they 've gone too far .

He stumbled badly in the first debate and never recovered . It takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservatives . They are smart and they research issues , they want substantive answers . Perry could n't answer the questions in depth and it showed .

If Perry was a Democrat , he 'd be their candidate - liberals will buy anything .... Hope and Change anyone ?

Pretty much , yea .

Obviously someone lied to him .

< / quote> 

I 'd call those both accurate statements .

Mittens is a frontrunner who only has about 30 % support in a four man race . That 's just kind of sad when you think about it .

And sorry . Most of the other candidates were a joke . When you had people looking at Cardboard Pizza Man seriously , there was a problem with the quality of candidates .

< / quote> 

Having the support of a third of the electorate in a four person race is pretty darn good .

If having 30 % of the electorate is kind of sad , what does that say about your candidate who does nt have close to that much ? 

< / quote> 

He does n't have 30 % of the electorate . He 's got 30 % of the maybe 20 million people who participate in GOP primaries . Which is only about 10 % of the electorate .

Right now , I 'm still behind Newt , but I 'd be happy with Santorum . But the fact he 's struggling with these guys after spending tens of millions of dollars and the MSM mercilessly attacking them says he 's a weak candidate .

It went wrong because he 's not smart enough to be President .

Serves you right for supporting an average candidate .
