The " fight " was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS .... IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE .

WTF are YOU babbling about ? 

< / quote> 

Why do you hate America so much ? 

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon / teabagger BS ? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon / teabagger cousin 's stupidity ? 

In America we have a thing called Due Process . We do not approve of Lynch - Mobs . I know that bothers you Socialists / Progressives , but that 's the way it is . So get over it .

< / quote> 

Hey genius , " due process " includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE .... that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning , drug / alcohol test . The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested , not " lynched " .

Intellectually dishonest libertarians / neocons / teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life .... but the FACTS will always be your undoing . Carry on .

< / quote> 

The only person in this process whose due process rights are a concern are George Zimmerman 's , are you trying to argue the police are railroading him ? If not , stop talking about due process .

You do n't believe in Due Process ? Man , you Socialists / Progressives really are lost . Maybe America is n't the place for you ? May i suggest China or North Korea ? Bon Voyage . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Due Process begins with proper police procedure , you stupe . As it 's evident , the cops in that area did n't even do that ! A matter of history , a matter of fact that ... which now requires scrutiny by other forces ( state and possibly federal ) .

But do continue to babble like a good little neocon / teabagger / libertarian flunkie .... it would be funny if it were n't so pathetic . Carry on .

Those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue .

The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman 's story checked out and they released him . That should have been it but the parents of the boy were n't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white , did it become a major story . Now that it is , Gov.Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it . the fact that after all that , Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman 's story still checks out . Mind you , it is only speculation on my part .

Please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact .

It took the PARENT of Martin 3 days before they got the word from the local police dept . as to what happened to their missing kid . Zimmerman was NEVER taken down to a precinct for an OFFICIAL questioning DESPITE being involved in a fatal shooting . He still has n't to this day .

No decent foresnics .

WTF is that all about ? 

If it were NOT for the due diligence of local black media ( and then national black media ) along with Progressive radio stations , the Main Stream Media would have kept this story on the back burner .... hell , Fox News was STILL the last one to catch on with coverage AFTER the Big 3 started coverage .

Gov. Scott is involved because of the PRESSURE brought by the various groups and the ( now ) national media examination .

Try dealing with the FACTS instead of your wishful thinking .

Zimmerman was taken into custody , and released after the police determined they had no probable cause .

Really ? Prove it ! Because to date he was NOT given a blood alcohol test , foresnics as to the ballistics from his gun , nor was the 911 tape brought into question as to WHY did he pursue and confront Martin when he told not to . So beyond a quick Q & amp ; A , what the hell happened ? Was his gun even confiscated ? ( and how the hell does a guy with a record get a CCWP ? ) 

As for the forensics , do you think the world works like CSI ? Most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science , and half of the real stuff they show wo n't hold up in court . Most police departments ca n't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists , so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy .

Who said anything about the CSI program , genius . Standard ballistic test to determine powder residue on victims and perps hands has been around for a LONG time , and is available to even the most remote precinct / station . If they do n't have it on the premises , they can send it to a regional one that does ..... and remember , it 's was OVER A MONTH before the " main stream media " picked this up , which is MORE than enough time for proper police work to have taken place .

Why do n't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others .
