Every single person who is assuming Zimmerman should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black .

Come to think of it , that would include you , which might explain why you do n't see it . The police report indicated that Zimmerman had a cut on his head , the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots , and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight . All of that proves that Zimmerman told the police the truth .

What the police have to find out now is if Zimmerman instigated the confrontation . If he did , he should face charges . If he was just following him to make sure he did n't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood , and Martin actually initiated , and escalated , the confrontation , he should n't . Until I know the facts I wo n't make a decision .

The " fight " was a result of Zimmerman PURPOSEFULLY CONFRONTING MARTIN WITH HIS PREJUDICE IDEALS .... IDEALS RECORDED ON THE 911 TAPE .

WTF are YOU babbling about ?

Why do you hate America so much ? 

Are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon / teabagger BS ? Or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon / teabagger cousin 's stupidity ? 

In America we have a thing called Due Process . We do not approve of Lynch - Mobs . I know that bothers you Socialists / Progressives , but that 's the way it is . So get over it .

< / quote> 

Hey genius , " due process " includes PROPER POLICE PROCEDURE .... that means you DO NOT just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning , drug / alcohol test . The call for justice is a call for Zimmerman to be arrested , not " lynched " .

Intellectually dishonest libertarians / neocons / teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life .... but the FACTS will always be your undoing . Carry on .

Candy Crowley on CNN , their chief political correspondent , this AM asked Gov Scott of Florida why it " took more than a month to react ? " 

Today is Sunday the 25th of March and the shooting took place on Sunday February 26th . That 's 28 days ago which is now exactly a month ago , and the Gov appointed a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate on the 22nd . So why was n't she able to report this factually , and based on that why should we believe her reporting ?

Those idiots can only think of one answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue .

The reason that it took so long is that the Sanford Police investigated the incident and determined that Zimmerman 's story checked out and they released him . That should have been it but the parents of the boy were n't satisfied and then ONLY because Treyvon is black and they thought Zimmerman was white , did it become a major story . Now that it is , Gov.Scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it . the fact that after all that , Zimmerman is still a free man today makes me suspect that Zimmerman 's story still checks out . Mind you , it is only speculation on my part .

Please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact .

It took the PARENT of Martin 3 days before they got the word from the local police dept . as to what happened to their missing kid . Zimmerman was NEVER taken down to a precinct for an OFFICIAL questioning DESPITE being involved in a fatal shooting . He still has n't to this day .

No decent foresnics .

WTF is that all about ? 

If it were NOT for the due diligence of local black media ( and then national black media ) along with Progressive radio stations , the Main Stream Media would have kept this story on the back burner .... hell , Fox News was STILL the last one to catch on with coverage AFTER the Big 3 started coverage .

Gov. Scott is involved because of the PRESSURE brought by the various groups and the ( now ) national media examination .

Try dealing with the FACTS instead of your wishful thinking .

Zimmerman was taken into custody , and released after the police determined they had no probable cause .

As for the forensics , do you think the world works like CSI ? Most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science , and half of the real stuff they show wo n't hold up in court . Most police departments ca n't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists , so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy .

Why do n't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others .
