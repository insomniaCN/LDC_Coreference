Having grown up in Beloit and witnessing what happens when the major employers bail out ( Beloit Corp and Fairbanks ) , this is sad .

I 'm not the biggest fan of what Janesville has to offer , yet my blue collar background knows first hand what happens to families when parents have to reinvent themselves career wise late in their lives .

Raised in Beloit as well and I know the affect Beloit Corp and Fairbank 's closures had on the city . My grandfather worked at that Janesville plant from age 19 - 49 . Retired . One uncle followed GM to Ft. Wayne IN and also just took retirement at a young age basically because who knows what will happen to that pension ( a brain tumor also played a big role in that decision ) . Another uncle works at the Janesville plant currently . This has been talked about for some time though . a few years ago it was pretty well known that there was less than 5 years at that plant . Hopefully people took that warning and have at least considered life afterwards .
