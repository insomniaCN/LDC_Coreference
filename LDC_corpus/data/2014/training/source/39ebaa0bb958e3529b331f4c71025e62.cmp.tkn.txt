You really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground ? 

< / quote> 

Legally . Yes . Clinton broke several federal statues . People have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less .

Politically . Not so much . He was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly , his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion . If he had Obama 's economic numbers , he 'd have been run out on a rail .

The millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when Ken Starr nailed down that he lied . They should have censured him and left it at that .

Oh gosh .

But I agree with your conclusion .

no , YOU made the accusation that the quotes are racist or bigoted . So YOU put them INTO CONTEXT and justify your opinion that they are racist or bigoted . Sallow did not do that with the highly biased and bigoted links he posted .

They are in context .

Exactly . Sexual harrassment lawsuits from malingerers cost $ $ $ $ . That 's part of the equation . Glad you are finally getting it , I was beginning to think you were stupid .

< / quote> 

Oh , give it up . They go for very cheap labor . Yeah , I 'm sure that includes getting sexual favors for free from workers , but that 's just a bonus .

You can go there and accuse all the women you like of putting pubic hairs on your coke can , and then carry on about how they should grow up .

But she got millions AFTER she stuck the knife in . Amazing .

< / quote> 

Are you gifting her with psychic abilities ? 

All she got at the time was trouble and humiliation , and the possible permanent loss of employment in her chosen field .

She took the risk because she had no choice . And somehow , you put that on her . Which is crazy .

Then they should stop whining about it . Actually , no one believes them because they usually end up suing for bullshit . Frankly , never saw a SH case brought that was n't complete BS , but good people got fired for petty BS because HR departments are running scared . True , they later find ways of getting rid of the malingerers , because that 's just a bomb waiting to go off .

You poor thing .

Being that you were completely wrong on the last three , and wrong on Hill being a 
Again , you ignored the issue . Obama called his grandmother a racist on national TV because he could n't bring himself to denounce the nasty , anti-American racist bile pouring out of the mouth of his pastor . The woman who raised him when his parents could n't be bothered .

Seems a lot worse than getting divorces from marriages that are n't working to me .

< / quote> 

Absolutely not .

Obama made a point that went way over your head .

The point that we all have racial bias that slips through at times . All of us . Every one of us .

To be a racist is a far more concentrated effort .

Joe , the links about Newt are in an earlier thread .

READ THEM .

You 'll find out about the child support , and the tendency to dump wives when they get sick , and the serial adultery .

But you 're right , the second wife was a lobbyist .

Now go read the rest .

Thanks .

Well , I did . Far left kook websites letting an jilted ex-wife break bad do n't count . And you did get the facts wrong about so many other things .... 

And you got one wrong AGAIN ( bolded ) & gt ; Callista is the THIRD wife , not the second ... Again , do you bother to do ANY research before wasting my valuable time ? 

Get your FACTS right before you shoot off your mouth .
