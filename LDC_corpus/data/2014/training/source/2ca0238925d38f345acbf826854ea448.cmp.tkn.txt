There has to be a present risk of harm , editec . Reasonable time , place and manner restrictions on first amendment rights are constitutional , but only if they pass muster on this point .

And those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at Matthew Snyder 's funeral , with the result that the family never even knew WBC was there . So why do we need broad new restrictions on speech , or liability expanded for speech , when existing restrictions already work ?

Apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done . It was proven in a lower court by a judge . Granted that was overruled in a higher court , that is how we got here . I highly doubt the Supreme Court took this case , only to agree with the appeals decision . A narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm . In this case , the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense . I think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it .

I 'm not so sure . To my knowledge IIED has n't been expanded anywhere to cover knowing and voluntary viewing of offensive material in the media or online , but with all the tort cases out there it 's hard to say for sure . I 'm uncomfortable with it though , for a lot of reasons .

The example of defacing a memorial site that Gadawg brought up is one thing , that 's essentially vandalism of another person 's property and the parents would be viewing it unawares . But what about when the " victim " voluntarily seeks out a site knowing in advance the content will be offensive and then claims millions because he was in fact offended ?

There are a couple other problems with this argument . The first is the sufficiency of the evidence , which was considered so vital on appeal it caused a split in the bench not over whether the evidence was sufficient but whether they could rule it was insufficient on an amicus waiver ( read the 4th Circuit ruling ) . The second being that the question of whether the speech was protected , a question of law , was given to the jury - which is only to determine questions of fact . The judge is to hear arguments and determine all questions of law . That alone pretty much guarantees this will be remanded for either summary judgment or retrial - under what instructions is what remains to be seen .

The court has both liberal and conservative points to make . The opinions will be interesting . The church is going to lose .

Tough case , but privacy and harassment enter the picture too .
