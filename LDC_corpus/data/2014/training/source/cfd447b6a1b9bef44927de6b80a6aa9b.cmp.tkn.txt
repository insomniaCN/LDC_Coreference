Ok ........ Drudge this morning said , " $ 87.00 / barrel " 

I still recall reading that the rough and dirty extraction price with oil shale was between $ 80 - $ 90.00 / barrel .

Now we have here in the USA an estimated 2.5 trillion barrels of oil locked up in oil shale . So we open - up a few " token " off - shore areas by the President , and everyone is suppose to be wetting their collective pants that we are on the way to energy independence from OPEC . Oh ........ give me a break ! Are the " sheep " really buying into this ? 

This 2.5 trillion barrels far - exceeds the total oil reserves of the Middle East , if not Saudi Arabia alone .

Now if we have extraction prices from shale at the above prices , you and I know that technology / research will not stop there , but there should be coming down the pipe , even cheaper methods of extraction .

Why , oh why , is n't this administration " green lighting " this area of energy potential with gusto .

Ethanol is a joke ! If we were to do as Brazil and start agri - farming , grow-able land to produce Ethanol , we would have to use every inch / acre of present land that is producing edible crops for our nation . We do n't have sugar cane climate here in the U . S .. Brazil is close to the equator , and is very humid / tropical , which is ideal for high - yield ethanol crops .

Sure , there s nothing wrong with bio-fuels ...... but they ca n't make but a golf ball sized dent in our energy consumption / needs . There 's only so much fast food / restaurant oil to be had , and the way the government is going after fatting foods to save our collective lives the amount of useable cooking oils will not expand with this economy IMO .

Why Not Nuke Plants ? : They 're one heck of a lot cleaner than the cleanest coal burning plants . Interestingly , I listened to a notable scientist , Dr. Bill Wattenberg , who has worked and Livermore Labs in weapons research , and also has been an independent inventer , and has been contracted by both state and Federal Gov , agencies to help " invent " ASAP methods / devices during emergency situations such as , temporary bridge replacements , mine sweeping equipment ...... etc , etc ... 

Wattenberg had emphatically said , over the years , that the amount of radioactive isotopes emitted into the atmosphere by even clean coal burning power plants is so immense , and health / dangerous .

Wattenberg has been an nuke power plant advocate for years , and has tried and tried to fight the panic , and b.s. poured out by the " left " and " green " wingnuts about the horrors of nuclear power .

France : They are on their merry way to independence from OPEC . Roughly 70 % of Frances' electric power comes from nuke power plants . France actually produces an excess of electicity , and is able to sell it off to other countrys ' grids . I also understand that France is stockpiling hydrogen , as their excess electricity allows them to " crack " H2O , into hyrogen gas .
****** 
Us or the U . S .. Our President , gave in to Harry Reid , and closed Yucca Mountain . This was a major multi $ $ $ $ $ $ project that was designed to store our nations ' spent nuclear fuels with a margin of safety that far exceeded the risks . Yucca Mountain was geologically studied for dangerous seismic faults that could rupture storage and cause dangerous ground water leakage of nuclear or hot wastes .

Containerization of spent fuels is so - beyond adequate , as the containers will far exceed the spent half - lives of these materials . Never the less , the wingnut , greenie crowd still holds sway over a certain major political party in our country , and I mean major lobbying pressure probably second to none . As a result , U.S. energy independence is held hostage to archaic , 19th century mentality / dreams ........ that " utopia " for all Americans is the destruction of industrialization , and the adoption of an agrarian mentality , and culture .

I 'm an idealist ........ but I " m also a realist . We have a party / administration in power that has a skewed , and illogical mentality and outlook on the future of this country . Nothing they propose encourages entrepreneurialism , but in fact hinders or destroys it .

Entrepreneurialism is the unspoken swear word of this administration .......................... Unless it fits into their illogical paradigm of American life according to their bible .

I live in Silicon Valley , the birth place of R & amp ; D on the nano - scale like no other place in our country . What is it now ? It is empty parking lots .......... building for lease banners everywhere .

Tech support goes to India now . For years here in Silicon Valley we had an incredible influx of Indian Nationals who were highly educated computer engineers for the most - part . Many gained legal citizenship , and have continued to contribute to our economy with hard working ethics ........... But ........... . now even our R & amp ; D is being jobbed - out to faraway India and other parts of the world . Manufacturing of hardware has gone to the far reaches of the world . That 's ok ........... but ........... R & amp ; D ? ?? That 's the bread and butter of " entrepreneurialism " ! 

We were a country of innovation ! So what 's our claim to fame now ? Oh we make " negative sum gain " windmills , and residential solar panels . Big whoopee ! We are the home of Tesla motors that only the " Sean Penns " of the world can afford .

Oh .............. I could go on and on and on .............
