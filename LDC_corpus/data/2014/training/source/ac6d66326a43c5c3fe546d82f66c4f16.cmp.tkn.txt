Bin Laden is dead . That 's perhaps .. the best news many of us have heard in the last decade . But , does n't the whole affair seem a bit odd ? I mean .. I do n't know .. but the timing for one ( just before Obama 's re-election campaign ) . Then there 's the fact of there being no footage and the body being buried at sea . When the United States captured Saddam Hussein .. his pictures were all over the news .. would n't it make sense to at least release one proper picture of Bin Laden too to silence all the critics ? Also , ASSUMING the whole thing is a sham .. it is n't too difficult to photoshop a picture .. so why has n't the US government done that ( IF the affair is fake , taht is .. ) 
The Iraq war and the ' danger ' of Saddam Hussein 's alleged arsenal of nuclear weaponry took place right before Bush 's re-election campaign in 2003 .. and now this in 2011 just seems a bit sketchy ( I still do n't know ) 
Also , how could they have been able to undertake the DNA tests AND bury his body so quickly when the place where the body was found .. Abbotabad is in the northern area of Pakistan and about a 1000 miles inland ( with only Pakistan 's extreme soouthern border being a coastal area ) .
I 'm also a bit confused about the details of the compound where Bin Laden is said to have been residing for the past .. five years ? I somewhat remember hearing on the news on the first ( or second ) day after his death that the compound was completed in the summer of 2010 . And I was reading an article in Time Magazine a few days after his death .. they said that the tape that was retrieved bearing Al - Qaeda 's confirmation that Bin laden was dead was found near the compound and had not been verified although it was assumed that it was in fact from Al - Qaeda . So , has Al - Qaeda stepped forward with their renowned video tapes as yet ? 

Are there any other facts or incidents that make his death seem a bit sketchy ? Or prove that it was correct except for various statements from governments etc .. because I mean , being a history student .. if the death was a sham , then this would n't be the first time governmetns have used propaganda stories for their benefit .. But then again , for all we know .. he could really have been killed or perhaps he 's been dead for a long time but getting caught by the USA seemed a befitting way for him to die ? I do n't know what to make of the whole thing to be honest .. I ca n't see his death reducing the scale of the 'War on Terror' .. But I do hope that the news of his death brings some closure to the 9 / 11 victims .. it 's been a tough ride for them .. and for all of us

When will people realise that governments , while they do lie / bend the truth , are nt going to be so stupid as to fake the death of a terrorist leader .

All Al - Qaida would have to do is drag bin laden out from where he is hiding , film him interacting with locals , including proof of date , and BAM ! obama administration collapses . They would nt take that risk .

They might be hiding him or something , in which case what is the problem ? We are at war with al - qaida . Sometimes during war you have to misdirect the enemy .

Take for example the british triumph of planting false documents on the corpse of a tramp and letting him be picked up by the enemy in WW2 . Sometimes I like to think that if the current generation had fought in that war , we would have lost . Hell , we almost lost it before we began by being too nice to the enemy . ( Something the americans know - al - qaida being armed by the CIA anyone ? ) 

That said , I think he is dead .

I 'm quite surprised how quick the yanks buried him . I thought they should spend weeks or months examining his body .

I think he 's probably dead , but I do also think that there is a possibility that the Americans have captured him and are keeping it quiet .

Agree . If indeed there was n't a big shootout , it ca n't have been beyond the wit of man to capture him . But the nightmare scenario is having him alive and in detention , awaiting trial . The first resort of Islamic militants is to take hostages , and they 'll do that and kill untold people until the point at which Osama gets convicted and presumably executed .

And how exactly do you give Osama bin Laden a fair trial ?
