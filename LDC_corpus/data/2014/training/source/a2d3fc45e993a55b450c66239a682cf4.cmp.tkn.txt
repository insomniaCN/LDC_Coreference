how did you know they would let GM fail , but not Ford ? 

< / quote> 

Because Obama was not going to allow the car companies to fail on his watch . Carter had the same issue in '79 I do believe it was with Chrysler . He did the same thing , gave them a loan , and they paid it back in full with interest .

Can you imagine unemployment if those three went under ? It 'd be insane .

And the amount that the three combined were asking for was nothing like the banks . And the argument that " Well , this is where the jobs truly are " prevailed .

And a good way to determine the company 's strength is to look at the Annual Report obviously . I had n't taken a deep look . But I just knew politics would come into play more than business .

except he let GM fold .

You are right . The media is stupid .

Reagan and the two Bushes created 92 % of the National Debt by lowering taxes on the rich and increasing wasteful military spending .

< / quote> 

And yet Republicans dishonestly claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility .

Why do they keep lying ? 

< / quote> 

Because people keep believing them .

The Big Lie of the Republican Party is the tax cut .

If you cut taxes and raise spending , you are actually raising taxes and passing the debt on to the next President .

< / quote> 

I guess they do n't want to accept the truth so they decided to take the thread off topic .

Oh well .

The thread is n't ' off topic . ' 

You missed something the rest of us were well aware of , and even were silly enough to make a thread about .

Well yes .

The main problem with Detroit was they were making cars that went against what America needed in a bad recession . So once the good times stopped rolling and people could no longer afford the gasoline on their hummers , what was going to happen ? The obvious .

I have to say , one of the things that the Japanese do according to their traditions is to make use of every space in the car . That and saving gasoline is huge , especially now .

What you see now actually is Detroit is getting into farming more believe it or not . But it will likely not fully recover for a long time . A LONG time .

President Bush expanded the federal budget by a historic $ 700 billion through 2008 . President Obama would add another $ 1 trillion .

President Bush began a string of expensive finan * cial bailouts . President Obama is accelerating that course .

President Bush created a Medicare drug entitle * ment that will cost an estimated $ 800 billion in its first decade . President Obama has proposed a $ 634 billion down payment on a new govern * ment health care fund .

President Bush increased federal education spending 58 percent faster than inflation . Presi * dent Obama would double it .

President Bush became the first President to spend 3 percent of GDP on federal antipoverty programs . President Obama has already in * creased this spending by 20 percent .

President Bush tilted the income tax burden more toward upper - income taxpayers . President Obama would continue that trend .

President Bush presided over a $ 2.5 trillion increase in the public debt through 2008 . Setting aside 2009 ( for which Presidents Bush and Obama share responsibility for an additional $ 2.6 trillion in public debt ) , President Obamas budget would add $ 4.9 trillion in public debt from the beginning of 2010 through 2016 .

As to ... " Why did n't we hear about the deficit during the Bush administration ? " 

Answer - You did n't read the NYT or WaPo or the internet ? You did not watch CNN or FOX News ? In other words , what 's this " we " stuff kemosabe ?
