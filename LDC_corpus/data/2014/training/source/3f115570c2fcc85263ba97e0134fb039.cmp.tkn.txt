This is actually quite amazing . Being a conservationist I have no problem with green energy projects . I believe in multiple sources of energy .

On the other hand I do have a problem with taxpayer dollars funding failures on the whims of nutjobs in Washington .

Earlier this week , Stimulus beneficiary Evergreen Energy bit the dust .

Then , Ener1 , a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles and recipient of Stimulus largesse , filed for bankruptcy .

And today , the Las Vegas Sun reports that Amonix , Inc . , a manufacturer of solar panels that received $ 5.9 million from the Porkulus , will cut two - thirds of its workforce , about 200 employees , only seven months after opening a factory in Nevada .

This is just this week alone .

They still pale to comparison to the $ 500,000,000 wasted on Solyndra . Someone needs to go to jail for that one .

Damn straight .

What really bothers me about this is that if you study Euro models of green energy , they are actually effective and do able ( how do you spell that ) . The issue is cost effectiveness . I was watching one business program with an awesome finance critic Amanda Lang and she had gone to Germany to interview people who had succeeded in affordable green .

But all I see over here is the government throwing cash at an issue demanding no results .
Consequently getting none either .

Just that deep flushing sound .
