A man renting a gun at the Shoot Straight range in Pinellas Park committed suicide Nov . 23 in front of others , including two teens and a father who told the Tampa Bay Times ’ Claire Wiseman he wo n’t return to the range . It was n’t the first shooting to occur at a range with a rented weapon . But even if it was , the practice of renting guns without a background check cries out for a review . The ranges should police themselves instead of letting the problem fester and inviting a possible legislative solution . We ’re talking about lives being lost .

Giving Tuesday stands as a relatively new concept compared to Black Friday , but the so - called ' 'National Day of Giving’' is no less meaningful . Instead of a video of two women fighting over a television set , maybe someone will post footage of volunteers delivering needed toys for teens 13 to 17 at Metropolitan Ministries .

Ran into Bucs and former Florida State linebacker Dekoda Watson last week while wearing my orange - and - blue Gators jersey . It was the perfect time for Watson to rub it in about Florida ’s woeful season , but he actually offered some empathy , recalling that FSU struggled not too long ago . There ’s a lesson there .

When I asked my son to tell me the best way to reach him , I wanted him to distinguish between text , email or Facebook .

But he said to get his attention , I should simply not transfer money into his account and he would contact me . Immediately . Apparently , he ’s learning a lot in college .

That ’s all I ’m saying .
