My mum died of cancer last April and I ca n't cope without her . She was my best friend and we did everything together . I saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times a day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine .

I have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright . Yesterday I was due to have an operation to remove my gallbladder and I was actually at the hospital and booked in when I told them I was feeling unwell and left .

I am so scared of having the operation and imagine all the horrible things that could go wrong , I had an op once before but mum was helping me cope with my nerves and helped me go through it . Yesterday I just kept thinking I need mum , I ca n't do it without her . It 's so stupid because I will still have to have it done and she wo n't be there .

I sit at home during the day and cry and cry . I hold my hands together and keep praying she will come back , I say over and over again " Please come back , please come back " like it will make a difference but I know it ca n't happen , I just want a miracle .

My husband tries so much to help and is so kind but it is n't the same and i 'm scared of stressing him out . The night before I was due my operation I was in such a state and he was trying to calm me and I saw his eyes were bloodshot . He has high blood pressure and I thought " Omg i 'm going to end up killing him " 

My kids are wonderful but my misery stresses them out , I really really try to hid it but they hear me blowing my nose alot and notice my eyes are red .

I have been on meds ( citalopram ) in the past but they make me feel really weird and I do n't like taking them . I go to a counsellor which is great when i 'm with her but when i 'm alone I start feeling low again .

I hate myself for being so stupid and not coping . I 'm an adult , and a wife and a mum . I know what a stress and misery I am for my family to be around , but I do n't believe I will ever get better without mum here to help me . I miss her so so much , I need her back , I ca n't believe she has gone forever - it is n't possible .

I 'm so desperate I just do n't know what to do , I want to hide in a corner and pretend none of this is happening . Please please can someone tell me how to cope , or even just hold up for my family .

i have to say that as I read your post I had tears in my eyes .

My own mum has cancer , in her breast 3 years ago and unfortunately we were told in October that it had returned in her bones .

I have the same relationship with my Mum as you have with yours and thinking of my life without her reduces me to tears on a daily basis .

She too is on morphine and we have good days and bad .

I wo nt offer you any advice as I know that when the time comes I will suffer in exactly the same way as you are now .

What I will say however is try to stay strong and think how sad your Mum would be to see you so distressed . If she s anything like mine she will want you to remember her with fondness as you move on with your life , making her proud of the person you have become WHICH IS ALL THANKS TO HER X 

Stay strong x

Hi i completely know where your coming from i too lost my mum to cancer at the age of 51 , it was a very short illness diagnosed in the October and she passed on 31st May 08 . My mum too was my right arm went everywhere together i phoned her every day . I was dumbfounded that my mum was gone just like that . I cried for my mum but i do n't think i 've ever grieved properly as i had my dad , brother and my two young children who were 3 and 1 at the time and i had to be strong for them . Moving on 3 years and i am now suffering from anxiety / panic attacks and have been quite ill for the past 4 - 5 months , the dr thinks it could all be down to my loss as since my mums passing i 've lost my nan , grandad , 2 uncles and my beautiful 25 day old niece . I 'm currently having counselling and i 'm hoping this works . I think you need to stick with your counselling and it sounds like you have a very understanding husband so lean on him all you can . Big hugs the day to day things do get easier but the pain of loss never goes away , just be assured that your mum is always with you and loves you very much . Clare
