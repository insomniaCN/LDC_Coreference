So essentially , for completely SUPERFICIAL reasons , we are rejecting the most qualified candidate and nominating a Ken Doll , hoping to God no one notices his religion is batshit crazy and he 's flip - flopped on every issue out there .

Yup . Makes sense to me .

< / quote> 

Those are n't superficial reasons . Gingrich is not a leader , at least not of the most important country on earth . The people whom he led in the past do n't want him now , and his temperament is not suited to the Presidency .

Sorry .

< / quote> 

Given those people were a large part of the problem , and could n't wait to get back to making deals with the other side , not seeing their objections as being the problem .

I look at the results - Balanced budgets ( kind of ) , welfare reform and serious changes in the way Congress did business .

But , heck , no , we do n't want any real reform . We want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests , because that 's worked so well for the country .

< / quote> 

Sure , I like Gingrich . He 's a very smart man . He did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due . I even considered supporting him . But I wo n't be .

I thought you said in another thread that you were n't voting in the GOP Primaries ... It 's kind of hard to keep your stories straight though ... 

And , hey , that cartoon you have in your sig line is just kind of creepy . Just sayin ' . Bring back the kitten .

As [ House ] speaker , I came back , working with President Bill Clinton . We passed a very Reagan - like program : less regulation , lower taxes . Unemployment dropped to 4.2 percent . We created 11 million jobs .   Newt Gingrich 

< / quote> 

" Former president Clinton would be shocked at this description , since he always credited the 22 million jobs created during his presidency to the deficit - reduction package he narrowly passed early in his tenure without a single GOP vote . "

I 'm not a huge fan , but I have to give credit where credit is due and he 's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates . I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses . He definitely offers the most substance in his replies , but a lot gets lost in translation . Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who ca n't even give a straight answer to a simple question like ' do the states have the right to ban contraception ?' 

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh - Boy . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

that was a stupid question and did n't deserve and answer .. and that 's the truth . ruth .

I do n't think that anyone has " killed it " in the debates .

< / quote> 

I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright . He has been married 3 times , currently for 13 years to Calista , and I respect the fact that , in spite of political consequences , he has been divorced 2 times , rather than having a sting of lovers , while married to one woman , as so many other politicians try to get away with . I like Newt because I trust Newt . He is the least PC of them all , thus far , and in my opinion .

Justin Quinn : " Gingrich has been married three times , and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs , although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife . " 
Source : Justin Quinn . " A Profile of Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich . " USConservatives . about . com .

< / quote> 

Newt has been neither forthright or accurate . The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post , on easily checked facts , demonstrates this .

Not that it will matter to the wingnuts who rely more on truthiness than truth .
