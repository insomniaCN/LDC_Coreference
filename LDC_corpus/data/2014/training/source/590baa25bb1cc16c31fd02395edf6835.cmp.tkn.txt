For the record : there is no ' class ' in the United States of America . It is not a class based society . 'Class warfare ' is what politicians use to divide Americans from each other - because that makes it easier for them to rob us all .

Only fucking morons support Democrats or Republicans . You people are the problem .

You 're confusing the word , " class , " with the word , " caste , " 

We do n't have a caste system like India ( or England , to a lesser extent ) .

But we do have a class system . Money and power are the usual determinants .

I agree on the miscarriage of justice . laws should be for everyone .

< / quote> 

It is far more likely that a poor person committing a crime will be convicted , but there 's a lot more to the issue than just convictions . A wealthy person is less likely to be charged . If he is , then he will have better lawyers . If convicted , he will get a lighter sentence . Once in prison , he more likely to be paroled . This is nothing new .

< / quote> 

Yep , and in the worst case buy a presidential pardon .

California Girl is correct . We do n't have a Class sytem yet . That carries major implications within society . If you are of the upper class in England ( whether you are rich or not ) there are doors open to you that no amount of money will buy entry into . The same holds true for India as well .

Here in the States you can buy entry through any door you see .

A very clear miscarriage of justice . I wonder how much the DA cost to be bought off . One million ? Two ? Ten ? Whatever the amount was , I hope he sold his soul and his ethics for a high amount .

< / quote> 

That case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system .

Hell , I did n't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel . After all , do you think O J Simpson would have gotten away with murder in the 90's without his ' dream team ' ? 

< / quote> 

I am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since ... well , mankind got ' organized ' . Who wrote " All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , " and when did he write it ? 

justice is sometimes a matter of simply , what you can afford . It has always been so .

here is another link to the story .

According to this the 2 misdemeanors are due to a plea deal , and the guy is pleading guilty to it . Furthermore it is his first offense , and no drugs or alcohol were involved .

In most juristictions if it is your first offense you can usually get anything below attempted murder or rape plead down to a lesser charge .

Also , now that he has plead guilty the victim can sue the living shit out of him . THAT is where the more well off can get slammed by the system . There will be 100 lawyers willing to take this case , and a deal wo n't come cheap for the driver . If you also read down , the whole thing about not affecting his livelyhood is explained as making sure he can still afford resitution .

< / quote> 

Not when someone is seriously injured . That places it into a whole new level . My assumption is the scumbag paid a huge anmount to the victim so that he would be OK with the reduced charges , then said scumbag paid a large amount to the DA 's re-election campaign and there you have it . Justice is served ... or sauteed if you prefer .
