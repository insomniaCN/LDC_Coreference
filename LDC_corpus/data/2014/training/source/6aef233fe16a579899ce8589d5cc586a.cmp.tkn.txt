Looking at his 59 points it seems pretty clear to me that Mitt is basically concerned about continuing with business as usual along with reducing the social safety net for poor Americans and reducing necessary regulation of businesses and the financial sector .

I do think the safety net for the poor is currently fairly effective . That is , qualified applicants are given food , shelter , and even money sometimes , are n't they ? I do n't know of anywhere in the US where there 's actual abject poverty . As for homeless veterens , I think that 's their choice -- maybe due to abuse of alcohol and drugs , or mental illness of some sort . Afaik , the VA has programs to help them if they want it .

Anyway , when Romney says that if the safety net for the poor is broken then he 'll fix it , I think that he 's just lying .

Is it possible that fixing the safety net might entail making it more streamlined and cost effective = more benefits spent on beneficiaries and less on administrative overhead ?

Ok , that 's a good point .
EDIT : In which case he would n't be lying .

For my statement that Mitt donated his inheritence to a university . Taken from his Wiki page : 

<quote> 
When his father died in 1995 , Mitt donated his inheritance to BYU 's George W. Romney Institute of Public Management and joined the board and was vice-chair of the Points of Light Foundation , which had incorporated his father 's National Volunteer Center ) . [ 40 ] [ 102 ]

Here is the part of the interview referenced [ 40 ] on Wiki : 

<quote> 
LAMB : By the way , why did your father not give you any of his inheritance ? 

ROMNEY : Well , he didnt have as much as I think some people anticipated . And I did get a check from my dad when he passed away . I shouldnt say a check , but I did inherit some funds from my dad .

But I turned and gave that away to charity . In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor , the George W. Romney School of Public Management .

And as an institute of public management , it helps young people learn about government and about serving in public service . And thats where his inheritance ended up .

LAMB : Did he have a philosophy that he didnt want to pass on a lot of money to his kids ? 

ROMNEY : Well , I dont think he had as much as some people might have imagined . And he spent his money on things he cared about . He was a real champion of volunteerism .

So he funded volunteer efforts and worked to support the things he cared about . My kids got some money from my mom and dad . They are happy that they were able to receive some funds . That helped them in their education and getting started in life . But in my case , I figured we had enough of our own .

LAMB : At some point I noticed you were on the Points of Light Foundation board , but you go back to either your father starting the volunteer organization that merged into Points of Light ? 

ROMNEY : Yes .

LAMB : Explain that .

ROMNEY : Well , my dad began a group , I think it was first called Volunteer . And the idea was to help people connect with volunteer opportunities . His idea was to set up offices around the country , some affiliated with the United Way , others independent , where people would know what volunteer opportunities were available in the community .

And then people could come in and say , look , I have got so many hours and afternoons , what do you have for me ? And they would try and put people together with volunteer opportunities . And he campaigned for that hard .

About the same time , President George H . W. Bush came out with the idea of the points of light and the Points of Light Foundation . It had a very similar concept . And the thought was , lets put these two together where George Romneys Volunteer organization could combine with the Points of Light Foundation and promote volunteerism , bring together -- one of the things was to bring together all the presidents , all the living presidents to promote volunteerism , something my dad championed and worked for .

He passed away just before that conference . And I was invited to step on the board and work with the Points of Light Foundation . It was a source of great honor for me to stand where my dad had stood , and to see this convocation of great leaders and people from around the country talk about volunteerism .

And the Points of Light Foundation continues to help the nation find opportunities for people to serve one another .

LAMB : You finished first in your class at Brigham Young University in Utah .

ROMNEY : Almost . I did very well at Brigham Young and I was the valedictorian in terms of speaking at the graduation . And I think I had the highest grade point in my college of humanities .

But I dont know who was number one in the entire class . So I will correct the record on that . I graduated with highest honors and I did pretty well at Brigham Young . I didnt do as well at Stanford , by the way .
