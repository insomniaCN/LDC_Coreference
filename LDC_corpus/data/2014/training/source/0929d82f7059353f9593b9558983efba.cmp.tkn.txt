I sure as hell know ZIMMERMAN has no civil rights complaint . Kid gloves for a guy who just shot someone else to death . Even police have to take time off work , not Zimmerman , he 's suddenly the VICTIM .

Who said Zimmerman is a victim ? Other than you , of course .

It 's the biggest , hottest news story in media .

Are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news ? 

Any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest , most powerful media organization on the world ?

Just watched Shepard Smith . He had on an older heavy set white guy who apparently was the author of the law . The guy who wrote it said this law does not apply .
Then Shepard went on about a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7 - 11 and while unarmed , was walking back to his father while he was followed by an armed man who police told to stop following the kid . The young teen is now dead and the killer is still walking around armed .

I know . It was really weird to see such a thing on Fox . Maybe because it 's coming from their token gay .

Or .... maybe it 's because those are the established facts of this gutwrenchingly sad situation ? 

Twit .

For the record , it is a Saudi , not ' the Saudis ' .

< / quote> 

Thank you for the link . But that info is from 2007 , best I can tell . He may own more now . Or less . But I doubt that he would sell any . It 's not like he needs the money .

< / quote> 

Wiki is easy enough to update - should the share percentage have changed , I 'm sure it would have been included .

The fact remains , you got shown to be a petty moronic whiner who clearly does not bother to fact check information . I do . Which is why I know that it is one Saudi , not ' the saudis ' ... and it is a mere 7 % - hardly a controlling interest .

So , how come you 're not accusing sallow of ' pulling ' information ' out of his ass ' ? Because he 's a liberal . Unlike myself . I 'm a conservative , therefore you challenge my information . You are a dishonest and mindless hack ... and a mindnumbingly boring poster .

< / quote> 

Two things here : 

1 - I thought that in the past , you laughed at WIKI being used as a source .
2 - I thought that in the past , you have claimed not to be a conservative , but an independent .

Discussing his injuries , how the killing " went down " indicates the killer is now the VICTIM .

Everything 's fair game on a public board .

If she wanted it to be truly " her business " she would have not been a member of this particular website .

Too much of the the " fair game " trash got a young man killed .

< / quote> 

This one I have to disagree with you adamantly on .

What got that young man killed was racist views and a demented man with a chip on his shoulder .

< / quote> 

That is an opinion , it is not established as fact .

The NRA heavily pushed the Stand Your Ground bill which Jeb signed . I think Fox wants to stay on good terms w / the NRA
