Lionel Tate who killed the 6 year old girl in while ' imitating a wrestling move ' pleaded guilty to second degree murder yesterday . He served three years in lock up , now he is on one year house arrest and ten years probation . Lionel was 14 years old at the time and weighed 166lbs . , she was 6 and weighed 48lbs . He was sentenced to life at age 14 but it has been overturned .

Is this just punishment for his crime ?

Just ? ... Hardly . He did n't just " imitate a wrestling move " . He kicked , punched and stomped her as well during a sustained beating , resulting in a fractured skull and a host of internal injuries . His mom , who is now in charge of the house arrest , was upstairs at the time of the murder . The kid is a monster with no respect for human life . His mom has already demonstrated her incompetence ( she had yelled down the stairs " keep the noise down " while the murder was taking place ) . It is likely only a matter of time until he hurts someone else . <img src= " http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt= " Rolling Eyes " / >
