The historical cliche is that as the economy suffers , so politics becomes polarised and people begin to search for irrational explanations for the cause of their misery ; people need someone to blame . Nazi Germany is often given as the shining example of this - " it 's the Jews ! Blame the Jews ! " 

There are obviously many important differences between 1920s Germany and 21st century Britain .

- Germany was raped far , far harder than Britain has been ; 
- the welfare state was completely falling apart leaving people facing homelessness and genuinely terrifying living standards ; 
- unemployment was something ridiculous like 8 million ; 
- we 're arguably far more tolerant ( some would say too tolerant ) and educated than 70+ years ago ; 
- Communism has gone from being a genuine threat to your life in in Germany , to being reserved for Bond films and textbooks today ; 
- We have a far more stable government ; 
- We have n't lived through a horrifying bloodbath of a war ; 
- Other stuff I have n't though about .

Has history repeated itself in any respect do you think ? I do n't really know so that 's why I started this thread . I have noticed a lot of implicit and explicit racism on TSR from a vocal minority but I wonder if that 's just always been there . I mean , have n't the Daily Mail and its readers been lambasting immigrants since the dawn of time ? 

Has anyone had any personal experiences of an increase in racial tensions at all ? Do you see the BNP increasing their portion of the vote in the next general election ? Is there anyone reading this who will consider voting BNP when they would n't have done so before ? 

Just wanted to hear some thoughts on what others think . Particularly the economic downturn 's wider historical significance .

Europe and the UK are still far more prosperous now than they were in the 1930s . Unemployment levels are not as severe and there is still welfare protection unlike in the 1930s .

Also , the overall demographic of migrants in Europe today is overwhelmingly young , male , and competitive . The indigenous European population is more skewed towards the older ( and female ) demographic . Thus the Europeans are more likely to moan and groan than resort to violence and aggression ( predominantly a young and male trait ) . Also , significant proportions of the 20 - 35 male population in major European cities are migrant men .

Well , to an extent they did . Certainly immigration has increased competition , especially for low - paid , low - skilled work , and the reciprocal benefits have largely been taken advantage of by well - educated white - collar workers who have had more opportunities to develop themselves and learn multiple languages . I 'm all for a bit of protectionism when it comes to labour markets .

And this is the benefits of living with **** & amp ; piss in your community .

Yeah , that 's a horrible and malicious attack which ca n't be condoned on any level .

But do you think it 's fair to imply that all Asians and Blacks subject Whites to racist attacks ? Are all white Texans members of the KKK ? Are all Germans Nazis ?

What ? ! You MAD ? It exists . If it did n't their would n't be racial attacks .

Only recently in the news a Asian man in the UK ( loads of cases ) was called " pa * * " and stabbed to death .

< / quote> 

The news has a tendency to exaggerate to catch your attention 

I shall rephrase my last comment , there 's no racism with intelligent people in our society 

If you know someone who is racist then either do something about it if you can or ignore them , not worth your time

Yes I think so .

I remember basically being made redundant and my boyfriend as well , being told there are no more hours for us where we worked , so it is best to just resign and look elsewhere . In the week we were leaving about 4 new polish people were being hired in the same area that we were and them constantly being given overtime , which was a little strange . They were all friends of the Polish manageress .

Luckily , me and the bf lived with polish people at the time and he is foreign himself , but i can see how to someone else going through that how it would really irritate them and start shifting their mindset towards immigrants and stuff .
