Shirley Sherrod , we now know that her video was edited , yet it was played on Fox again and again . And when poor Shirley was forced to resign , Fox comes out with a report , just tonight , that Obama threw an " innocent " woman under the bus . Now , Fox says she 's innocent . Only now .
What video ? What report ? 

Then there 's James OKeefe and Acorn . A single Republican , able to bring down an organization that helped the poor , from spliced together video tapes . Well , he is getting sued . But , " he did it " . Now all those poor people are a little more poor .
WTF are you talking about ? 

Then there were Republican leaders privately telling Obama that they would work with him and then publicly , saying they would do everything they could to bring him down ( they called it " Waterloo " ). And they did . And poor Obama believed them time and time again . I wonder if he believes them now ? 
" They " who ? Which Republican leaders ? 

There was Iraq . That was because of WMDs , no , because of yellow - cake , no , it was to bring " freedom " , no , it was ..... 
How many years back are we going to go here ? 

There was the 2.4 trillion dollar tax cut . Supposed to bring jobs . And it did . It brought them to China and India and even Mexico .
Still looking backwards ? 

Then there was April 16th 2008 , Healthcare Decisions Day ,  proclaimed by the former Gov. of Alaska , Sarah Palin . In fact , it was such a good idea , that Democrats used the SAME legislation in the Health Care Bill . Only Sarah stopped calling it , " Healthcare Decisions Day " , no , instead she called it " death panels " and " kill grandma " . Another fast one .
Never heard of it ..... Link ? 

And this unemployment bill ? Stripped of everything that would help the economy . Now Republicans say , " Where 's the roads being built ? Where 's the dam 's being restored ? Where 's the bridges being fixed ? " Well , they should know . They forced Democrats into removing them from any legislation .
Roads , dams , and bridges were supposed to be paid for with the failed Stimulus package , not the ' unemployment bill ' .

Imagine if Republicans put all the sneakiness into helping the middle class . Into actually rebuilding the country . Into being on the side of regular Americans . Yea , imagine that .

Do any of you guys know how to use a " search engine " . Every fucking thing has to be " spoon fed " . And still you believe lies over truth .

Try , " Sarah Palin Health Care Decisions Day " and there 's about a million hits in 3.5 seconds .

And you do n't know about Acorn and James O'Keefe ? Seriously ? 

And what 's happening today is because of what happened , uh , " backward " .

Goofs .

I do n't spend my days surfing for news bytes to find something to bitch about .
Contrary to the persistent vomiting of 24hr news networks , the news does n't really change as often as their advertisers would have you believe .

You opened with vague remarks , assuming the world knows WTF you 're talking about , and respond by calling people goofs for not being as lacking in a real life so as not to be stuck watching bullshit 24 / 7 like you .
