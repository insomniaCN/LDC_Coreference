Prosecutors in Budapest , the capital , said Bela Biszku had been on a committee of the Communist Party that ordered the shooting of civilians in Budapest and Salgotarjan , a town in northern Hungary , in November and December 1956 . Historians say many civilians were killed and arrested during the uprising . If convicted , Biszku could be sentenced to life in prison .

The charges , more than 20 years after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe , come as countries across the region are seeking a reckoning with the past . In September , Romanian prosecutors charged Alexandru Visinescu , commander of a communist - era prison , with genocide . He was the first Romanian to face that charge since dictator Nicolae Ceausescu , who was tried and executed in 1989 .

Biszku , who was Hungary â€™s interior minister from 1957 to 1961 , was charged under a 2011 law , championed by the center - right government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban , that permits the prosecution of crimes committed during communist times . Orban rose to prominence in 1989 when , as an opposition leader , he called for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Hungary , embodying the aspirations of the whole region .

The uprising by Hungarians in 1956 , though violently repressed , became a pivotal event that stirred the hearts and minds of people across Eastern and Central Europe and undermined communist regimes across the region .
