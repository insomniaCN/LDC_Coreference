Yes he did look away ! Looking away is exactly what he did it is in the indictment document ! ( See bottom of page 6 and top of page 7 . ) 

As for the lack of empathy , I base my opinion on his subsequent actions which showed no empathy for the boy he witnessed being raped ( the lack of informing anyone but his manager , the way he did not try to find the boy or identify him so that the victim of the rapist could receive the help they needed , his lack of curiosity about why a child rapist was still allowed on the premises and so on ) . How have you come to the conclusion that he had empathy for the victim of the rapist ?

See my response to Darat , above . In 28 years , you 're told like a zillion times to respect authority , mind your own business , let the adults handle this , what you think and feel is not important , etc. , etc. , etc. You are probably not told even once what to do if you see a man raping a child in the shower .

< / quote> 
But unless you are an idiot , you can figure it out based on the following two facts that you do know : 
Raping a child is a crime The police are in charge of handling crimes 
That 's it .

Further , as someone who works at a public university , I will assert with some confidence that he was , in fact , told exactly what to do in this situation . On day one , I was told in no uncertain terms that it was my duty to inform both my supervisor and the campus police department of any suspected illegal activity I witnessed , and that failure to do so would lead to disciplinary action , including possible termination . I find it difficult to believe McQueary was not told the same or similar .

So someone could see a man raping a ten year old and not understand what they were seeing ? What else could this possibly have been ? Again , you are trying to interject an ambiguity that does not exist .

Child rape is terrible . It is not incomprehensible . If what was seen was an alien raping a ten year old while making pancakes , then yes , that in fact would have defied human comprehension . It is not incomprehensible , particularly since we know that child rape exists . It is not outside our rhealm of knowledge of possible human behavior .

He did n't look away and he did have empathy for the victim . 28 years old sounds old but it is n't .

< / quote> 
28 is an adult . I just turned 30 . By the time my husband was 28 , he 'd fought in a war . I 'd been married for 3 years , and half my friends had had children .

28 is not 12 . 28 is not young enough to have an excuse not to act .

Well I 'm sure it is a great comfort to the victim that the man who looked at him , saw him being raped , and walked away without calling the cops was " distraught and upset . " 

I 'm sure that makes the rape much less rapey now .

Steve Spurrier is the head football coach at the U of South Carolina , the state your info says you 're in , and he was a famous coach at the U of Florida before that , so I was just seeing how far your lack of familiarity of famous football figures extended . Overall Paterno is more famous than Spurrier but in the state of South Carolina maybe Spurrier is more well known .

Mike McQueary is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the Penn State family . Son of prominent local businessman , star quarterback for the local schools , eventually Penn State quarterback . If there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with Paterno , it was him .

That explains a lot .
