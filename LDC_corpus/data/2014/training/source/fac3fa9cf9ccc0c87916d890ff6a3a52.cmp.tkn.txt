Well , since I did n't see ONE democrat actually protest his December attack on Iraq ( you know , the one we just had to do the exact same four days the House was holding impeachment proceedings ) , it stands to reason you were n't all that outraged at the time .

< / quote> 

That is pretty irrational . You 're comparing a full scale invasion to one attack on a factory ? 

< / quote> 

Uh , once again , you get your facts wrong ... and wonder why you are a joke . Operation Desert Fox was NOT just an attack on one factory . It was a widescale attack on hundreds of Iraqi facilities .

You are probably thinking of Operation Infinite Reach , which was an attack on Sudan and Afghanistan ... 

<a href= " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Afghanistan_and_Sudan_ ( August_1998 " >http : / / en . wikipedia . org / wiki / Bombing ... n _ ( August_1998< / a> ) 

I know , it 's tough . So many half - ass , ill thought out bombing raids to distract from his piccadillos , it 's hard to keep track .

No , everyone did n't . Richard Clarke tried to warn the Bush administration repeatedly about bin Laden . The Clinton administration conveyed their concerns . Our intel knew that bin Laden had directed attacks from Afghanistan . Maybe bin Laden was news to you , but he was n't news to me , and he sure was n't to the administration .

< / quote> 

Clarke was part of the Administration that thought issuing an indictment for Bin Laden was calling it a day ... He also tried to claim that Condi Rice did n't know who Bin Laden was , until they dug up a bunch of interviews that indicated she clearly did .

Misleading the public into war is as big a crime as I can imagine .

< / quote> 

And oddly enough , the Democrats never impeached anyone for that when they got control of Congress . In fact , Bush flipped them off and said , " Screw you , I 'll escalating the war ! " and they ran off like whipped dogs ... Hilarious .

<quote> 
No , we 're in to , " They suck at their jobs , but do n't you dare say so or I 'll call you a racist " territory . Judging by the way liberals treats black folks like Herman Cain and Clarance Thomas , I think we know who the racists are .... You minorities and women can only be successful when we say you can be .

< / quote> 

You are talking yourself into a circle . You 're not racist when you baselessly insist that Hill is an affirmative action hire , but some imaginary liberals are racist if they criticize Thomas and Cain for specific , non-racial reasons .

< / quote> 

What specific reasons are those ? Frankly , all I see is that you guys are made these men made it without the welfare state or the pity party ...

Regarding signs at the Tea Party , there was a large sign of a concentration camp at a prominent rally in DC . Well known Republican politicians spoke at the rally . No , offensive signs were not necessarily taken care of . And I certainly saw a lot of those Obama as witch doctor signs at a lot of rallies , and I did n't see people being told to leave .

< / quote> 

You know what else you did n't have at the TEA Party rallies . The police did n't have to come in and arrest anyone . People were n't defecating in the street and littering the place . They cleaned up after themselves and left peacefully after they had made their point .

Unlike these dirty , filthy OWS people , who are now hoping for a " Kent State " moment to bolster their cause .

Oh , right . Because clearly , none of these guys who had been around Washington longer than Bush had knew anyone over at the CIA or Pentagon . Because they had n't been looking at the same intelligence in the 1990's that said the same things .

Reality check , guy . The Democrats went along with the war because most of the country was in a mood to kill someone in 2003 , and they did n't much care who . Then like naughty children who had too much candy , they looked for someone else to blame .

< / quote> 

I believe I said the same thing a few posts back . Yes , Democrats failed in their duty . So did the media . They are guilty of insufficient diligence . The Bush administration is guilty of actually pushing the war . You know , sins of omission and sins of commission .

The nation had a lot of questions about Iraq , and was willing to wait for inspections . Bush was n't .

A dictator who was n't a threat to us , had n't caused us any problems , and who was actually co-operating with us at that point . And all he had to do was let power go to some crazy Islamists who are already sizing everyone up for Burhkas ... 

< / quote> 

Yes , and then his people rose up . Unlike the people of Iraq . They asked for UN help . Unlike the people of Iraq . They overthrew a dictator with limited help from the outside world . Unlike the war in Iraq .

They may choose badly in their new leader , but they are at least off to a good start .
