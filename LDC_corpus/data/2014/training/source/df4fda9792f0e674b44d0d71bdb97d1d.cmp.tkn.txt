This thread is devolving into the usual " Rape the Rich " bullshit from the mindless left . That 's too bad , because Mustang touched upon an interesting subject in the OP .

We do have a disparity of " justice " in this nation , a severe one . The well connected are virtually immune to our laws , Marc Rich was as bad or worse that Bernie Madoff , but a quick bribe to Bill Clinton ensured that he was immune from prosecution for his crimes .

<a href= " http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,99302,00.html">The Marc Rich Case : A Primer - TIME< / a> 

Ted Kennedy murdered a girl who was pregnant , assumable with his child , but then , paternity tests were never run , due to his " status " he was never prosecuted .

Bill Clinton openly threatened Betty Currie that if she did not perjure herself he would fire her and ensure she lost her pension . But since he is a powerful democrat , he got away with it .

Time and again we see that there is one set of laws for the well connected , and a vastly different set for the commoners . And it is n't just being able to afford high end attorneys . Clinton was never Criminally CHARGED with witness tampering and racketeering , though absolutely proven guilty , it 's on tape . Kennedy was never CHARGED with murder , though it 's irrefutable that he did murder Mary Jo .

Back room deals are cut to keep the well connected from even facing a court room . No need for lawyers because the strings are pulled so that they are n't ever charged in the first place . This nation was founded on the principle of law , yet we see that this is n't what we have . Partisans cheer the subversion of the law because " their team " got away with it , and they care only about their party , not justice . The justice system is a farce and we all know it . Corruption is the rule , not the exception . Even at the municipal level the very concept of justice is perverted . We have traffic laws that exist for no reason other than to fine motorists . If a man with a gun targets a person purely for revenue , what can we call this other than armed robbery ? All the way up the chain this goes , judges handing out long sentences to ensure that the prison guard union has plenty of work , in return for donations to keep the judge in office .

In California a woman got a ticket for talking on her cell phone . The law said it was a $ 20 fine .

So she was fined $ 20 , then assessed a $ 250 processing fee , then an $ 80 court fee . So was this upholding the law , or just armed robbery ? 

Our justice system is rotten to the core , so what are we going to do about it ? Play " Rape the Rich " games because that 's what Obama wants ? Should we be occupied with envy and greed like the Shitters , demanding more for Unions and Illegals , or should we really look at the shambles our injustice system is in ?

Regarding the comment : " Rape the Rich " from the mindless left .

Let me see if I understand your point of view . Wealth and power are in fact concentrated to a decreasing number of people ; and you take objection to their abuse of power to manipulate the justice system . HOWEVER , you find it inanely absurd ( to the point that it is mindless ) to think that the same wealth / power is not used to manipulate the law making process , tax code , or financial institutions . Is that accurate ?

Not really .

The the population in the top 1 % , 5 % and 10 % of income earners has stayed pretty static relative to total population since 1990 .

Yes , I oppose corruption . I have no issue with wealth . The more wealth created , the better . I support wealth and oppose corruption .

I 'm the opposite of the democrats , I suppose , who oppose wealth and favor corruption .

Again , the issue is one of corruption . Equal justice under the law is the foundation of this nation . We have lost that , we have distinctly different laws for the well connected than we do for the common people .

Wealth and power often go hand in hand , in the case of the Clintons , the wealth is a by - product of political power . It is the connections that pervert the law though , not the wealth .

Simply put , I believe that Barack Obama should be held to the same law that Tyrone Jackson in San Bernardino is - and I do n't think you can argue that he is .
