This morning I was watching " Good Day New York " on Channel 5 , which is part of the FOX network . The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on - going occupation of Wall St. , and were ( of course ) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals . During his response , the man pointed out that it 's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St. / banking giants ( individuals and corporations ) .... and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in . He stated that Al Sharpton " a self made man from the streets like me " was joining .... . at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected ( twice ) that like Al Sharpton , Rupert Murdoch is a self made man .

<img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again ? 

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U . K . ( Australia ) . He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul .

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion . Big difference .

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the " class warfare " line that 's heard from the neocon / teabagger pundits in the media . By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful " every man " , co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just " jealous " of " successful people " .

Typical Fox BS .... but not unexpected .

Hate to point out the obvious ( I lie ) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country . He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth . If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one .
