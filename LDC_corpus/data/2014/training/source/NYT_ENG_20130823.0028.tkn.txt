JERUSALEM - Four rockets were fired toward northern Israel from southern Lebanon on Thursday for the first time in nearly two years , according to the Israeli military . The rocket fire set off sirens in the western Galilee and raised tensions in the region against the background of the conflict in Syria .

Two fell between buildings in Israeli villages , damaging property but causing no injuries . Another appeared to have fallen in an open area .

Capt. Eytan Buchman , a spokesman for the Israeli military , said Israel suspected that the rockets were launched from the village of Qlayleh near Tyre in southern Lebanon by what he described as “ global jihadist elements . ”

“ We see this as an unprovoked attack on the Israeli home front , ” Buchman said .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised statement that Israel was “ acting responsibly ” in the realms of defense and prevention and that Israel ’s policy was clear .

“ Anyone who hurts us , anyone who tries to hurt us should know that we will hurt them , ” he said .

The Lebanese army said in a statement that an “ unknown group ” fired the Katyusha rockets from an area south of Tyre . An army unit searched the area and found four wooden launching pads , the statement said , adding that the army was investigating to find the perpetrators .

Any indication that Hezbollah , the militant Shiite organization in Lebanon , was involved in the latest rocket fire would signal a more serious risk of an escalation of violence . Hezbollah fired thousands of rockets at Israel during a 34 - day war in 2006 that left more than 1,000 Lebanese and several dozen Israelis dead .

A fragile cease - fire has since prevailed between Israel and Hezbollah , which is backed by Iran and is now helping the Syrian government fight rebel forces .
