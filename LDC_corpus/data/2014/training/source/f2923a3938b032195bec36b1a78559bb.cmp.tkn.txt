First thing . The Atomic Bombs were not ready until Summer 1945 . Germany surrendered in April . We had no reason to drop said bombs on Germany .

The reality is that it took BOTH bombs to get the Emperor of Japan to over ride his Army Controlled Government and order an immediate surrender . With those bombs we would have starved Japan through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an Invasion of a Home Island which would have seen MILLIONS of dead Japanese civilians and soldiers .

Japan was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with Bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion . The continued invasion of Japan could have seen the potential elimination of the Japanese race .

The lie that Japan was ready to surrender is revisionist history . Japan under the Army had no intention of surrender . What they " offered " through the Soviet Union was a cease fire with Japan keeping everything she still possessed and the return of Japanese home possessions like Saipan and Okinawa . Japan was offering to let us just stop attacking them . They would retain all of their Chinese , Korean and other possessions and we would return their home island captures .

Here is a link to SOURCE documents verifying that Japan was NOT offering a meaningful surrender , that even after two atomic Bombs the Army controlled government refused to surrender , that the Emperor failed to act until after the second atomic bomb and that the Army attempted a Coup to prevent the Emperor from surrendering .

The atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let Japan keep everything from before the war and not disarm . They SAVED millions of lives .

You 're full of shit . The proof is not in what you stated , it is what you completely avoided . There are two simple yet often overlooked fundamental aspects that prove the bombs were not meant to get Japan to surrender .

( 1 ) We had their offer to surrender before we dropped the bombs . It was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the A - bombs and dropped them .

( 2 ) The bombs were not dropped to intimidate Japan . There were dropped to intimidate Russia .

CurveLight , if this is the truth , then why has no bright lawyer ever sued the US on behalf of Japan for damages of one sort or another ?

You mean like we 've been paying off civilians in Vietnam , Iraq , Afghanistan etc ? Or like how Japan is paying off A - Bomb survivors ? ( not a typo -- yes . Japan has been paying A - bomb survivors ) 

I would guess because it would n't get any traction . A recent example is how a Federal court rejected a lawsuit based on " national security . " A German Citizen was kidnapped by the US , taken to secret prisons , and tortured before it was discovered he was completely innocent . His whole hellish nightmare lasted for months . Upon his release he sued the US for the above crimes and the case was dismissed for " National Security Reasons . " 

Without fact checking , I 'm confident in saying lawsuits have been attempted and denied .

The Japanese had several negotiated settlements on the table . None of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies .

The surrender offered by Japan prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs .
