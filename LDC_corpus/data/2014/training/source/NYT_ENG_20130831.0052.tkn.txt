KABUL , Afghanistan - Dollar for dollar , Mahmood Karzai may well hold the title for getting the least value out of his pricey American lawyers . Karzai , a brother of President Hamid Karzai , paid one of them $ 100,000 , and all he got was a single meeting and one follow up email - and then the lawyer died .
< / P> 
<P> 
Now he is looking for someone new to sue the estate of the dead one . “ I need to find a good lawyer , ” he said in an interview .
< / P> 
<P> 
While it may not be surprising that a Karzai has access to high - powered legal help , thanks to an economic boom underwritten by the United States , there are more Afghans than one would imagine who have the money to pay legal talent from places like New York and Washington - and who have the reasons to need it .

<P> 
It was probably inevitable that lawyers would follow American dollars to Afghanistan , and the arrival of some of the most prestigious law firms on the scene in recent years says a lot about just how good a business opportunity this war has been for many people .
< / P> 
<P> 
First came the military contracts : deals with Afghans to do all kinds of things , including shipping supplies for American troops and hauling out human waste from military outposts .
< / P> 
<P> 
Then came the crackdowns , and lawsuits , when jobs did not get done right , or the money simply went missing .
< / P> 
<P> 
And now many Afghans who grew wealthy off American contracting are learning that the price of keeping their good names , their revenue streams and , potentially , their freedom starts with a six - figure retainer .

<P> 
“ We paid them when they started our work , and we paid them when they finished , ” said Ahmad Rateb Popal , chairman of the Watan Group , an Afghan security and logistics firm . There was , he noted , “ no bargaining . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
The lawyers in question were from Venable of Washington . The Watan Group hired the firm after being banned in 2010 from doing work for the U.S. government over allegations that it had paid off the Taliban to keep supply convoys safe .
< / P> 
<P> 
It cost almost $ 1 million in legal fees to get the ban reversed , and Watan still had to agree not to guard convoys for three years , Popal said . At the time , much of the $ 25 million to $ 30 million a year Watan was making on work for the United States was for convoy security .

Venable did not respond to a request for comment .
