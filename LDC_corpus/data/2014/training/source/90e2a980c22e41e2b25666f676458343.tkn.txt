My marriage has finally ended after 20 years .

2 weeks ago I finally plucked up the courage to tell my husband I could no longer put up with his drinking .
He says he has n't got a problem just has a few drinks to unwind after work .
His few is 5 - 6 cans of lager and a bottle of red wine .
After the weekend of spending £100 up the pub , £50 on takeaways and £70 on a tattoo session I just felt I could n't take no more .

It was the hardest thing I have ever had to do because I was expecting i m to fly off the handle and smash the house up , but he just packed a few things and went .

He just assumed I was having a hissy fit and I 'd let him back home in a few days , but I stuck to my guns . Few days later he came back for some more things and even took the rest of the beer in the house , so much for saying he was going to stop !!!! 

On saturday night we met up to talk things through and he said he would respect what ever decision I made , I told him that he had to change before we could start to work this out and he needed help with his drinking . His reply was let me move back in and i will stop . I said no you have to prove you can stop first .
We did n't really get anywhere so he dropped me home and told me to go and that it would be a 50 50 decision to split .

Sunday lunch time I geta text to say if i ca n't live with you I do nt want to live without you take care x 
I ignored it , then another 1 came through to say £10000 should cover the mortgage 
Then at 8.30 in the eve me , the kids , his mum and sister all get a text saying sorry love you x 

His mum gets hold of him to find out he has drunk 2 bottles of wine and taken 50 odd painkillers .
He got taken to A & amp ; E and is still in hospital now .
I have n't been to see him as I 'm so angry and hating him .

He has cleaned out the bank account , so there is n't enough to cover the direct debits and nothing for food at all , 
just do n't know what to do now .........

Oh god what a mess .

Although I do n't know if it 's any help , the thing you hear most about alcoholics is that they have to hit rock bottom before they accept they have a problem and this sounds pretty rock bottom to me .

I guess the first thing for you to think about is that this is clearly a blackmail tactic , if you do n't take me back I 'll top myself . If you do take him back though , you send the signal that you 're prepared to accept things continuing as they are . Do you have his mum 's backing on what you 're doing ? Is she prepared to acknowledge his alcoholism ? Personally I think you need to stick to your guns . Being angry should help you a bit , at least in the short term .

For the money side , I 'd suggest seeing if you can make an emergency appointment with Citizens Advice to see where you stand benefits wise . You might also try posting on the benefits board here to see if anyone can suggest any routes for you . Do you have any family who can help you out ? For bigger stuff eg mortgages etc , if you are going to have problems paying you need to let them know asap . I think the guys on the debt free wannabe board will be helpful on this front , eg helping you figure out how much to say or not to say . They can also help you prioritise your bills etc. 

Sorry I ca n't be of more direct help , hopefully some others will be able to offer more advice . All I can say is look after yourself . And that I definitely think you have done the right thing for both yourself and your husband .
