LOPEZ IS SAID TO BE FINED OVER SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS 
< / HEADLINE>

<P> 
A New York legislative ethics panel will impose the largest fine in its history on former Assemblyman Vito J . Lopez for reportedly sexually harassing several of his former employees , people briefed on the decision said .

<P> 
The fine is said to be $ 330,000 , although the figure has not been officially released .

<P> 
Lopez was the subject of a scathing report released last month by the state ’s Joint Commission on Public Ethics . Under state law , it was left to a panel of lawmakers called the Legislative Ethics Commission to fine Lopez for violating the state ’s Public Officers Law . The fine was reported Tuesday by Newsday .

The penalty is unlikely to personally cost Lopez , since he can pay it using his campaign funds . He had more than $ 1 million in his campaign account at his last filing in January .

Lopez declined to attend a private hearing held Tuesday . His lawyer , Gerald B . Lefcourt , expressed anger that Lopez ’s legal team has not been allowed to cross-examine his accusers .

“ This is a total , laughable lack of due process by people who are supposed to care about the law , ” he said . “ It is all politics . ”

The joint commission ’s report detailed Lopez ’s behavior with eight female employees , including accusations of physical sexual assault and pressuring women to stay with him in hotel rooms or apartments . He was also accused of creating a pervasive atmosphere of sexual hostility , pressuring women to dress provocatively and massage him .

<P> 
Lopez , the former Brooklyn Democratic chairman , resigned last month under pressure after the report came out and has said he plans to run for City Council . The legislative commission can pursue legal action if Lopez refuses to pay .
