I 'm interested to know what you would consider to be a happy ending to your situation ? I suppose a happy ending would be where him and his wife mutually decide that their relationship is not worth salvaging 

Your original post / question suggested to me that you are not happy with your relationship and now I have read the entire thread , your subsequent posts have confirmed my initial thoughts . No , I am not happy with things as they currently stand 

I would not be surprised if his wife had uttered the same words and possibly another mistress .

Unfortunately , the damage has been done and you and your lover have hurt people - they just do n't know it yet , but they will find out eventually . They will then have to live with the devastation and you and your lover will have to live with the fact that you both caused the damage . Whether this was intentional or not , you are now aware of what you are both doing . I am aware of it 

I think you need to pay more consideration to what you believe to be the state of his marriage - everything you know is what he has told you , only one side of the story . He may be telling you what he believes you want to hear or what he believes he should say in order to sustain the relationship you currently share . I personally do not believe you are propping up the relationship in anyway but I am very interested to know why you feel this may be the case ? IMHO , you would be the perfect excuse for him to leave his relationship . If you were not available , what excuse would he have to leave ? Unless of course there was someone else ? His relationship may have indeed not been perfect before you arrived ... but was there maybe someone else to distract him ? Regardless of what people may say on here , and how much they may think I am being just used as a fool , I do not think this . I do n't believe he is a serial philanderer , or that he is taking what he is doing lightly . Yes , I would be the perfect excuse to leave , but I know he does not want to disrupt his childrens lives at this point in time .

Again , unfortunately , none of that will matter to the people you are both hurting .

I do n't want to upset you and I am sorry but do feel you should consider why he does not think you are worth leaving his wife for if his marriage is as he states .

You have a big decision to make and I believe you already know the answer but just need convincing / encouragement that it is the right thing to do possibly . Do you have any friends you can discuss this with ? I do hope you make the right decision for all involved . As someone mentioned previously , treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself .

Aside from the above , I am intrigued to know why after so long your daughter does not know about your relationship . Please do not share your reasons if you do not feel comfortable - you owe no explanation to me . It 's just that I have drawn my own conclusions and I am curious to know if I am right or wrong <img src= " http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> My daughter does not need to know about this relationship as he is not part of her life , he is part of mine and she has no reason to meet him . If we ever were to get together as a ' proper ' couple , then I would feel it appropriate to introduce them 

I wish you courage <img src= " http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

have nt read many of the posts here but basic story is my wife 's ex had an affair ( his other women was also cheating on her husband ) and he ended up leaving her and his children for the other women , who also left her husband for him , they actually stayed together for 10 years however they have now split up because she has had another affair .

so can they have a happy ending ? who knows i believe they probably could as i do not believe my wifes ex husband could have another affair based on how he was after he had left her and children ( guilt etc even after 4 years when i first met him ) however his ' other women ' of course is a case of not changing her spots 

personally i would nt want to be the bit on the side

You say your son has met him , so basically what you are saying to him is that he can get married and cheat on his wife if the " going gets tough " . Wow , what a great mum you are !

This is my thread in a similar vein but seeing it from the other side , as a woman whose husband has had an affair .
