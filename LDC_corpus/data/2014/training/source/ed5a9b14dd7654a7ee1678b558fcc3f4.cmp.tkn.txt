Your Honor , 

I present to you Exhibit A : 

<quote orig_author= " California Girl " > 
He inherited 2 regional Australian newspapers from his father . How outrageous ! A kid inheriting the family business ... albeit a pretty small one .

< / quote> 

and Exhibit B : 

<quote orig_author= " Tipsycatlover " > 
It means that after inheriting two small nondescript newspapers , Murdoch turned those into a media empire and is a self - made mad . The parasitic class at OWS just want everything for nothing . They are having fun at the expense of New York . They get to take drugs , drink , have lots of anonymous sex in the filth they produce and no one can touch them . This is the life ! 

< / quote> 

You will note how the subjects both attempt to vaguely push the meme that the newspaper business that the mogul inherited by birth , not from his own hard earned work , are somehow " mom ' n ' pop " shops , or in some far away remote 2 - bit third - world country , not one of the world nations of the Western Civilization . The goal here , you see , is to pretend that the mogul did n't have much to begin with , just like the regular Joes , and then was able to turn his 2 - bit mom'n ' pop business into a world media conglomerate ... you know , like a good self - made billionaire media mogul .

When the whole world and / or any one with an ounce of common sense knows that the Benefactor started of with a well established powerhouse of a media business in those newspapers he inherited .

Your Honor ... I rest my case .

I knew about Murdoch 's inheritence YEARS ago when he little SOB horned into NYC .... but you 'd think our resident neocon / teabagger parrots would at least do a simple google to check out something rather than just pull it out of their posteriors . To call The Sunday Mail is the equivalent of the local PennySaver speaks of gross ignorance or a tremendous personal dishonesty or a desperate need to defend the GOP agenda and beliefs above all else ... or in the case of the neocon / teabagger / oather / birther / libertarian clowns we deal with here , a combination of all three . Sad , but not unexpected

This morning I was watching " Good Day New York " on Channel 5 , which is part of the FOX network . The co-host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on - going occupation of Wall St. , and were ( of course ) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals . During his response , the man pointed out that it 's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by Wall St. / banking giants ( individuals and corporations ) .... and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in . He stated that Al Sharpton " a self made man from the streets like me " was joining .... . at which time co-host Greg Kelly interjected ( twice ) that like Al Sharpton , Rupert Murdoch is a self made man .

<img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/confused.gif"/> Come again ? 

Rupert Murdoch INHERITED HIS FATHER'S OWNERSHIP OF TWO NEWSPAPERS IN THE U . K . ( Australia ) . He did NOT start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul .

Al Sharpton grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion . Big difference .

I saw this as just another Fox flunkie pushing the " class warfare " line that 's heard from the neocon / teabagger pundits in the media . By trying to equate Murdoch as a successful " every man " , co-host Greg Kelly pushes the subliminal context that the Wall St. protesters are just " jealous " of " successful people " .

Typical Fox BS .... but not unexpected .

< / quote> 

Hate to point out the obvious ( I lie ) but when Murdoch inherited those tow papers in Australia he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country . He then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth . If that is not a self made man I have never heard of one .

< / quote> 

Hate to point out your painfully obvious regurgitation of a false premise ( I lie ) , but his editorial work for a London tabloid DID NOT lead up the ladder of hard work to being head of one of Australia 's leading news paper The Sunday Mail ..... he INHERITED that when his father died .

Murdoch , the son of Sir Keith Murdoch ( 1886Â–1952 ) , a famous Australian war correspondent and publisher , studied at Worcester College , Oxford ( M . A . , 1953 ) , and briefly worked as an editor on Lord Beaverbrook 's London Daily Express , where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher . His father having died , he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance , the Sunday Mail and The News , both of Adelaide 

No one is denying Murdoch 's personal success .... but to keep trying to push this BS that he 's a " self made man " is just that ... BS . Only a complete idiot would believe that an editor of a tabloid becomes the overnight owner of TWO major newspapers based solely on his merit and salary . But then again , in the desperate attempt to defend the neocon / teabagger status quo and legends , a Quantum Windbag will blow any smoke necessary . Carrry on .
