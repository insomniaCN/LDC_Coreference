This is mind blowingly stupid . Do you remember 9 / 11 ? Do you grasp that Clarke and Clinton were right about bin Laden , and Bush and Condi were wrong ? 

< / quote> 

I would say everyone was wrong about Bin Laden . But Clinton had eight years to do something substanive about the guy , from when the first WTC attack happened , to the bombing of USS Cole . And he did nothing . He let the guy walk out of the Sudan ( after the Sudan had offered to turn him over ) and into Afghanistan .

Bush on the other hand , wiped out most of his network , toppled the two regimes that Clinton said was aiding him ( Iraq and Afghanistan ) froze his assets , captured or killed most of his key subordinates . To the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear .

Okay , Lumpy , I 'm ready now . I 'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy .

Has anyone been saying anything good about him ? More specific than how smart he is ? I have n't been paying attention to the whole thread . Lotsa noise in it . But if you have , could you summarize the high points ? 

What does Newt plan for the nation starting in 2013 ? 

I 'm ready to listen ! <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

I was kinda asking for the beefs , there 's beefs a plenty ... <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/> 

I have n't read the whole thread . I did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals . They seem to want to keep Republicans on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down .

I think Democrats have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise . They use religion as a weapon .. it just not appropriate .. 

Sorry I ca n't summarize the high points ... Sharks & amp ; NY Islanders starts in 15 minutes ..

I started my own thread for high points instead of beefs .

But it was royally hijacked . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/> 

Hope it 's a good game !

I 'm flattered ... and , most threads are .. and , Sharks won on a bad ref call .. and a goal of course .. <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

No. Everyone was n't wrong about bin Laden . Clarke was right . Bill Clinton was right . George Bush was wrong before 9 / 11 . The people you 're citing who attacked Clarke were wrong . They complained that Clarke kept coming in with his hair on fire --- which means that he grasped the reality of the problem BEFORE 9 / 11 . But in order to defend Bush , the right has been forced to attack Clarke for being overzealous ... instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when Clarke 's hair was on fire , Clarke was right .

Clinton was obsessed with bin Laden to the point that he was criticized for it .

As for Clinton passing on bin Laden , are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread ? <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

Yes , it says that we are not rigid ideologues .

As for ' why we lost ' , that 's pretty funny . Look at the crop of candidates that the Pubs have this go round .... please , do n't compromise your principles . Nominate Newt , and let him go down in flames . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_pray.gif"/>
