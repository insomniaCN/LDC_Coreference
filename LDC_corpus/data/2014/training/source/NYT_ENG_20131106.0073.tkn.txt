JEWEL THIEF'S HUSBAND SEEKS SEIZED ITEMS 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
At first glance , the 41 - page list and photographs of expensive watches , bracelets , earrings and other jewelry pieces look as if they were part of a glorious wedding registry at a store like Tiffany & amp ; Co. 
< / P> 
<P> 
In fact , the list does have a Tiffany connection , but one that stems from a much less happy occasion .
< / P> 
<P> 
The roughly 300 pieces of jewelry on the list were seized by the FBI this summer from the home of a former Tiffany executive , Ingrid Lederhaas - Okun , in Darien , Conn . She was a vice president for product development until she left the company in February .
< / P> 
<P> 
While employed there , prosecutors have said , Lederhaas - Okun stole merchandise from the firm and resold it to a leading jewelry buyer and reseller in New York . When she pleaded guilty in July , she agreed to forfeit more than $ 2.1 million , her plea agreement shows .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ I knew it was illegal to steal and I did so regardless , ” she told a judge .
< / P> 
<P> 
But now her husband , Robert Okun , is asking the judge , Paul G . Gardephe of U.S. District Court , to hear his claim that “ a vast number ” of the seized jewelry items belong to him and should be returned .
< / P> 
<P> 
The government has “ laid claim to numerous items of personal property to which it has no lawful right under the forfeiture statute , ” Okun ’s lawyer , Bernard V . Kleinman , said in a court petition .
< / P> 
<P> 
For example , Okun ’s petition cites about 40 sets of cuff links seized by the FBI that he says he bought for himself , and another set that he bought for his son .
< / P> 
<P> 
In a phone interview , Kleinman noted that his client had not been charged and had “ no knowledge whatsoever ” of his wife ’s crimes .
< / P> 
<P> 
He said that the U.S. attorney ’s office in Manhattan “ takes an extremely expansive view of what would be subject to seizure in a forfeiture proceeding - let ’s put it that way . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
The U.S. attorney ’s office had no comment .
< / P> 
<P> 
Under the law , the government may seek to have a defendant forfeit assets that are the proceeds of a crime : stolen money or items bought with it , for example . But when a defendant has disposed of stolen goods and the proceeds can not be traced , prosecutors may seek forfeiture of “ substitute ” assets ; that is , untainted property belonging to the defendant that can be used to cover the obligation .
< / P> 
<P> 
The philosophy of forfeiture is straightforward , said two leading forfeiture experts who have reviewed Okun ’s petition and are not involved in the case .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ She stole the property . She should not keep the loot , ” said David B . Smith , a former deputy chief of the Justice Department ’s asset forfeiture office .
< / P> 
<P> 
The other expert , Steven L . Kessler , a lawyer in New York , said that if the husband ’s descriptions are accurate as to how he came into possession of certain pieces of the seized jewelry , “ I think he has a very strong argument in favor of the return of some or all of that property . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Smith said that Okun was entitled to anything that he owns ; it can not be forfeited .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ It does n’t make any difference who bought it . The question is , who owns it today ? ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Thus , a wedding bracelet on the list that Okun says he bought for his wife when they were married in 2000 would not be returned to him and may be subject to forfeiture by her , the experts said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Okun ’s petition also cites about 100 checks that he made out to Tiffany or to his wife for jewelry purchases totaling several hundred thousand dollars through 2006 , two years before she began stealing from the firm . These pieces “ ought not be subject to forfeiture , ” Kleinman argues in the document .
< / P> 
<P> 
As for Lederhaas - Okun , who still faces sentencing , she has already begun to satisfy her obligation , her lawyer , Sabrina Shroff , said .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ She intends to make full restitution , ” Shroff said , “ and has already given them her entire pension check from Tiffany . ”
