U.S. SEEKS TO BLOCK AIRLINE MERGER 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
The Justice Department , along with the attorneys general of six states , filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to block the proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways .
< / P> 
<P> 
The $ 11 billion deal , announced in February , took American out of bankruptcy . It would create the nation ’s biggest airline , a company with the size and breadth to compete against United Airlines and Delta Air Lines , which have grown through mergers of their own in recent years and are currently the biggest domestic carriers .
< / P> 
<P> 
But in the complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia , the Justice Department said that the merger “ will leave three very similar legacy airlines - Delta , United and the new American - that past experience shows increasingly prefer tacit coordination over full - throated competition . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
The complaint goes on , “ By further reducing the number of legacy airlines and aligning the economic incentives of those that remain , the merger of US Airways and American would make it easier for the remaining airlines to cooperate , rather than compete , on price and service . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
US Airways stock was down 7 percent in trading after the suit was filed .

<P> 
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of the attorneys general of Arizona , Florida , Tennessee , Texas , Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia .
< / P> 
<P> 
The action is the latest in a series of prominent antitrust moves by the Obama administration Justice Department .
< / P> 
<P> 
In January , the agency sought to block Anheuser - Busch InBev ’s $ 20.1 billion acquisition of Grupo Modelo , the Mexican maker of Corona beer ( that deal was later modified to win approval ) and in 2011 it thwarted AT & amp ; T ’s proposed $ 39 billion takeover of T - Mobile USA . ( Those companies abandoned the merger . )
