[ QUOTE=make me wise ; 44480052 ] Did anyone ; family , friends , teachers etc ever praise you as a child OP ? Not just when you achieved something , but along all the little steps it took to acomplish something . My view is that you do nt seem to look at how much you have achieved and feel a sense of pride in yourself .

Actually no , they did n't . My mum wanted me to achieve a lot and I was a straight A student , from school year 1 up until graduation from University . She used to say that for me to get a B is worse than to get a D . So I guess I am indeed a perfectionist .

Sadly , my mum has passed away already a few years back ( as has my dad ) , both in their early fifties . And I think the reason I am trying so hard might be because they would expect me to do well in life so I am still trying to make them proud . To be perfectly honest , it is killing me to think that I am not living up to my mum 's expectations , whatever they were .

Can I ask OP , what sort of wealth did your family have growing up ? Is this a case of not having much and trying to build it all up in one generation ? Or is it a case of trying to match the level of your parents but with different incomes ?

I went to a state school but it was selective . I come from a middle - class family but after my parents divorced life became more difficult financially . We were never poor as such but it was difficult for mum . SInce then I am terrified of having no money . So the mere thought of having savings in the bank makes me feel content .

I guess that 's part of the reason why we did so well saving up 90K .

Then this is what you need help with . Go get counselling , I am sure that your parents would have been proud of you whatever you acheived , only it looks like they never got a chance to tell you this .

I reckon this is the issue you need help with . When you have paid your mortgage you are still going to feel this way unless you get some help for your feelings .

When you get your Â£500k house , it 'll still not be good enough because you have these unresolved issues . Sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but I think you need counselling to deal with your parents death and their assumed expectations .

I really do n't understand people who have children , then insist that the children must have the best of everything , so work all the hours under the sun and moon in order to pay for * the best * when the really best thing for those children is quality time spent with their parents .

Children are only children for such a very short time and they do n't need holidays in florida , private education and all the other trappings that * the Jones ' * have .
What they NEED , is a parents undivided attention . Time to take them to the park , bake cakes , go splashing in puddles and days out at the seaside .

OP , you have your values and priorities wrong . There has been a lot of very good advice given to you , I really hope you take it , for the sake of your health and especially for the sake of your children .
