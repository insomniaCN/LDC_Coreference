Actually , he told his father , who told him to tell Paterno , THEN he told Paterno the next day . Who waited a day before telling his boss , who waited a week before telling his boss , who did n't do anything of merit apart from taking the keys to the locker room away from Sandusky .

edit : Also , the GA did n't just witness a child being molested . It really needs to be stated that what the GA saw happening was full anal intercourse with a ten - year - old boy . The fact that it was then euphemized as " some horseplay in the showers " by administration officials is something that really outrages me .

According to McQueary that is exactly what did happen - have you not read the indictment ? 

< / quote> 
I did n't read it . Did the kid say anything ? Did McQueary have eye contact ? If so and McQueary walked out , he should be fired as well .

I think you mean " Paterno " . At any rate , according to the GJ report the boy and McQueary did make eye contact when he saw the boy being raped .

Yes , my bad . Gawd knows why I do n't catch those typos , I try to re-read posts after I post them but I still seem to make lots of errors .

The kid has never been identified , so we only have McQueary 's word for it . And McQueary says that both the child and Sandusky made eye contact , and saw he was there .

Read the testimony . Very little is left to the imagination ... and there is precious little room for interpretation .

McQueary said Sandusky and the kid saw him but he did n't say there was eye contact . I mean , saying they saw him could mean eye contact or it could mean no eye contact . Just clarifying , in case it matters .

I think it is likely there will be some fakers ... actually very likely ... I speak from the experience of my own province .

This will cost the University at least 100 million . There will be a huge pot of money there and people will do almost anything for money .

Penn State loyalists should not worry about the school 's bank account . All it takes to refill the cache is a few dot - com billionaire alumni who still care deeply about their alma mater . Note the Jesuits on the west coast are still living high off the hog despite the many bankruptcies supposedly resulting from the claims of their hundreds of rape victims .

Most research so far has refereed pedophilia as a ' paraphilia ' , which essentially means getting off on sick and abnormal things and situations . I 've read that some professionals have called pedophilia a sexual orientation because , just like ' homosexuality ' and ' heterosexuality ' , it is usually stable and is formed early in the sexual development . Notwithstanding whether calling pedophilia a sexual orientation is in anyway good and informative , this naturally causes all kinds of controversy because it includes such freakish monsters with " normal people " and how it supposedly ' normalizes ' pedophilia and child - molesters . A common theme is that people started to make homosexuality acceptable then later it will be pedophilia and then it will be ... the end of society ? & lt ; snip & gt ; 

< / quote> 

So pedophilia is not considered a result of a developmental disruption ( like rape or molestation as a child ) and therefore preventable ? I was so hoping ... 

I assumed that was what happened to Michael Jackson .

I have n't read every post , but I have n't heard about any of his victims actually coming forward .. Have they ?

One article I read said the average pedophile has over 200 victims in a lifetime .

I do n't know about paedophilia generally , but wrt pederasty in particular I read one article somewhere that said it was caused by an extreme form of sexual narcissism . Its basically love of an idealised , younger version of the molester 's self .

So I suppose it would be caused by similar things to those which cause Narcissistic Personality Disorder . I 'm not sure though , I 'd have to look the article up .

They must be considering children in images and videos the pedophile looked at in order to arrive at 200 . That ca n't be the number they physically touched .... if that 's what you read there is no way that is true .

You know how you read something , and a half - formed thought comes immediately to mind ? 

My half - formed thought was ... has it then been incorrect all this time that some victims become abusers ? Does that then never happen ? I 've heard that it does , all my life it seems . But if pedophilia is an orientation , like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual ... then victims do n't " become , " do they ? ... or do they ? Or what ? <img src= " http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/confused.gif"/>
