Hi Lovepigeon , 
Ca n't say what you want but can tell you what we did .
We had a civil ceromony at a country house , with a wedding breakfast .
That s where we desided to spend the money .
On the savings side ........................... 
A friend made the cake , another played guitar before the ceromony , 
My dress was from John Lewis ( not a wedding dress ) 'A' hired his suit , 
( had shirt made , as wedding present from me ) 'A' played in a band , played in the evening .
We invited who we wanted , ( yes we left out some people inc family ) 
We did n't have a top table , we did n't do speaches or a 1st dance .
It was our day , how we wanted and it was WONDERFUL .
We went to Brughe ( sp ?) booked flights & amp ; hotel online the day before the wedding . Bargin and Fab .

You just have to think WHAT YOU WANT , it may seem tough on others .
BUT IT 's YOUR DAY .

We ended up with a more elaborate wedding than originally planned because we went to Speke Hall to look around and I fell in love with it ( doubling our budget * oops * ) .

But what I 'd have gone for in your situation would be a registry office wedding with two witnesses and a party in the evening . Hire a village hall ( normally very cheap ) , fill an iPod with music and borrow some speakers , get some platters of meat , cheese , salad and bread and some wine ( you can get some great deals if you can take a day trip to Calais ) , and invite your family .

Having said that , we had our evening dinner at a really nice restaurant ( has a Bib Gourmand ) - 26 people , three courses plus coffee and great wine and soft drinks and the total cost was Â£790 . The buffet / music / buying the drinks in / hire a hall option for a larger group would have been a little bit more , so it depends on how many people you want to invite .

I think it 's quite sad that there 's such a huge " wedding industry " these days and most people seem to feel the ONLY way to get married is to have a massively expensive party for dozens of people .
We seem to have lost sight of the meaning of the whole thing ... is it only me who thinks it odd that weddings should be held in settings and in a style which bears no relation to the couple 's real life together ? 
I do n't mean that if a couple both work stacking shelves , they should be getting married in a supermarket - more that we should consider weddings at home or near home , with friends and the sort of food we really enjoy , to be the norm .
I always think the twee starters / roast dinner / fake - looking pudding type menu is very peculiar when you remember that most couples would probably sit down to something totally different in almost any other situation !

I think all of your options sound really expensive ! ( disclaimer - I 'm not engaged or planning a wedding , but I am in a long term relationship , thinking about it possibly when debt free ) .

I have always felt that people spend shocking amounts on weddings - I think your 3 - 4k is massive , let along the tens of thousands that some spend ! 

I like the ideas that Jody and Sugarspun have mentioned . Have a quiet registry marriage with just the important people there , followed by a party for everyone done cheaply . I would n't budget anywhere near 3 - 4k on it though ! 
If a honeymoon is really important to you , you can still spend a grand or so on that , it counts as a holiday that you might have taken anyway I guess .
