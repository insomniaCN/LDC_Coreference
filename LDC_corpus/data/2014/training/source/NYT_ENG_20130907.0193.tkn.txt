Familiar ground on coach 's fast track 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
Less than four years ago , Nick Sheridan was on the same Michigan State sideline he ’ll walk today as a USF assistant coach , but then , he wore a helmet as a backup quarterback for Michigan .
< / P> 
<P> 
As the Bulls face the Spartans today and look to regroup from a humbling 53 - 21 loss to McNeese State , Sheridan has a challenging offense to implement against one of the nation ’s top defenses .
< / P> 
<P> 
Just as USF coach Willie Taggart was 24 when he became QBs coach at Western Kentucky , Sheridan is equally precocious . His return to Michigan is a reminder of just how much he has accomplished at 25 , already a full - time assistant in college football .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'I ’ve learned a ton from Coach Taggart , and try to just relay the information I learned from him and what was successful in this offense in the past , '' said Sheridan , whose title is QBs coach and passing game coordinator . ' 'If players feel like you can help them play better , then they ’ll respect you and listen to you . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
As a high school senior , Sheridan broke his collarbone midway through the season , but quickly transitioned to coaching his replacement . He landed at Michigan as a walk - on , working behind future NFL quarterbacks Chad Henne and Ryan Mallett , and earned a scholarship , starting four games as a junior in 2008 .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'He was a true joy to coach — knew not only what he was supposed to do , but why he was supposed to do it , '' said Arizona ’s Rich Rodriguez , who coached him at Michigan . ' 'I knew instantly that if he wanted to get into the profession , he ’d be pretty good at it . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
After graduating , Sheridan spent one fall coaching at his high school in Saline , Mich . , then landed a job as a graduate assistant on Taggart ’s staff at Western Kentucky . He was promoted to full - time coach , and when Taggart got the USF job , he was one of five WKU assistants to join the Bulls staff , with a $ 160,000 salary .
< / P> 
<P> 
By coincidence , coming to USF put Sheridan in the same city as his father , Bill , who came to Tampa last year as the Bucs ’ defensive coordinator . Nick has grown up immersed in football and coaching , at college and pro levels , but his father said he ’s smart enough to succeed outside the family business .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'He ’s a sharp kid . He probably should n’t be in coaching , '' said his father , who coached at Michigan State ( 1998-2000 ) and Michigan ( 2002 - 04 ) and still has a home near Ann Arbor . ' 'He has a political science degree from Michigan , but he went into coaching , which his mother ’s not too pleased about . But Nick ’s a smart guy , so he ’d do well at anything . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Taggart ’s mentor , Jim Harbaugh , was a former Michigan quarterback turned coach , and Sheridan ’s dad was a graduate assistant in 1985 - 86 when Harbaugh played there ; he also coached with John Harbaugh at Cincinnati from 1989 - 91 , so the name carried strong connections for Taggart . If that got him the interview , the maturity with which he carried himself got him the job as a grad assistant .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'When he came in and interviewed with us as a GA , it was unbelievable how professional and mature he was . I call him an old soul . He ’s probably more mature than I am , '' said USF offensive coordinator Walt Wells , 45 . ' 'He ’s what I call a gym rat … up in the office first and last , studying tape . He understands the game . I tell him all the time , he ’ll be the head coach at Michigan probably when ( he ’s ) 35 . ''

Rodriguez was a college head coach at age 25 , at Division II Salem International in West Virginia in 1988 , and said it is n’t easy for a young coach to command authority from players at an age where you can be easily seen as a peer .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'That ’s the hardest adjustment — there ’s a separation , in that now all of a sudden you ’ve giving instructions instead of getting them yourself , '' he said . ' 'Nick , growing up as a coach ’s kid , understood that more than anybody because he ’s been around coaches all his life . '' 
< / P> 
<P> 
Nick was born in Maine , but the family calls Michigan home — his father coached the Spartans while Nick was in fifth through seventh grade , so he knows East Lansing and Spartan Stadium well . He never played against Michigan State , but knows Michigan went 2 - 2 against the Spartans during his time there ; his brother Mark is a safety at nearby Albion College , a Division III school .
< / P> 
<P> 
Taggart , who became a head coach at 33 , likes Sheridan ’s smarts , of course , but also likes his temperament , how his even - keeled nature can help level out his quarterbacks ’ emotions , whether the score is good or bad .
< / P> 
<P> 
' 'He ’s very calm , during good times and bad times , '' Taggart said . ' 'To keep them where they do n’t get rattled , Nick ’s one of those guys . He ’s really good with our quarterbacks , a good teacher , a good mentor for those guys . He brings a lot to it , more than the football part of it . ''
