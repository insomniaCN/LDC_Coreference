The above of which as you know are the ( unfortunate ) fallout of terorrism and assasination 
As opoossed to pakistan armies execution of millions of unarmed bangladeshis in 1970 which is highlighted by many to be one of the biggest attempted genocides of the 20th century .
Yes that s an interesting comparison you try to bring up . That s ignoring pakistans harbouring islamic terrorism for 3 decades too .

Yes , that 's right , systematic rape and the cold blooded torture and murder of around 90,000 people is unavoidable . As is the the killing of perhaps over 10,000 Sikhs by mobs armed to the teeth and supported by the police . Please concentrate on admitting all this and not trying to justify them . Yes there 's a cause and effect for everything but unfortunately for you this includes so called Islamic terrorism - note how these acts are irrevocably linked to the persecution of Muslims / invasions etc. 

I have already said the genocide is a massive blot on the face of Pakistan - regardless " millions " were n't killed , estimates by neutral historians are around 300,000 dead . The Pakistani and Bangladeshi authorities obviously give wildly biased figures .

The bangledeshis should know , they buried the victims of the pakistani army - both they and neutral sources quote millions as murdered and raped - " one of the biggest genocides of the 20th century " . Interesting again how your figures fluctuate wildly - your wiki link mentioned 2000 odd now you jumped to 10k . No wonder no one takes you seriously .

I immediately noticed a MAJOR flaw in the title .

It 's not 'Westernisation' its 'Modernisation' do n't blame the West for something they have not done .

I have neither the time nor the patience to get drawn into another circular argument with you but put your own house in order before pointing fingers . Perhaps you would be best served to look at the 90,000+ mostly innocent people murdered in Kashmir by the Indian Army since the the late 1980s , the rape of thousands of women , extrajudicial torture of suspects and the many thousands Sikhs murdered , raped and tortured ( often with the police turning a blind eye or even taking part ) during these alone : <a href= " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_anti-Sikh_riots</a> 

I have provided you with a hell of a lot of sources for all this before from all over the board - it 's not Pakistani propaganda dear , it is proven fact . We have made many mistakes in the past but the India has no right to judge given its own record .

Again , this discussion was baout 1947 , if you want to move on to other time periods , then the human rights sites shown last time can be produced , and we can see full truth that both sides have committed atrocities there , condemn both individual Indian soldiers as well Pakistani backed terrorists , also we have Kashmiri Pandits ethnically cleansed from valley , and what about Bangladesh 1971 , when Hindus were targeted and ethnically cleansed , well , we can also talk about Balwaristan and Balouchistan .
India has a long way to go to reach Western Standards of Justice , endemic corruption by Politicians means a lot of self serving muppets with vast staches in Swiss bank accounts .
End of the day condemn killing of innocent human beings regardless of who carried out those killings

During a 2 day conference in mid-2005 , held by the US DOD , the Bangladeshis themselves said that the official number of civilians killed was around about 300,000 which had been misquoted in the past as 3 million .

As for the anti-Sikh riots estimates range from a highly unlikely 2700 to around 20,000 ( that 's what my wikipedia page says as well by the way ) . The Ahuja commission set up by the Indians themselves quoted the number of Sikhs killed in Delhi alone as 2733 .

Awwwhhh maybe it 's not me who does n't get taken seriously ? <img src= " images / smilies / frown . png " / >

Exactly , no point either side denying the atrocities committed by it , that kind of thing only leaves lingering bitterness and paranoia .
