My son has ADHD and Autistic Spectrum Disorder . He is 5 and in Year 1 .

The school know he has this obviously and told the CDC he ' was fine ' at school so the doc was really rude and said that I needed to do what the school was doing .

However , I went to see them to review his IEP and they said he has huge concentration issues ( amongst other things ) and they can not get him to sit and write more than 3 lines .

They said he could take a figdit toy so I bought them but within a day I was told that actually he could not take it as he chewed it and it would spread germs .

Last week a different teacher came in for the day in and they kept him back for 15 minutes to make him finish a piece of colouring in he had not done as ' he made her really cross as he would not finish it ' .

Tbh I was speechless and did not know what to say and just waited for him to be let home . He did not finish it so he had to being it home and finish it ( fair enough ) . I asked if they had showed him the time as he needs visual prompts and she said 'I told him he had 10 minutes ' I asked if she showed him 10 minutes and she said no. 

She also told them to implement SEAL but they have not done this either .

They have not implemented the Social Stories as advised by the Speech Therapist so this could have helped him understand . I have spoken to the SENCO and asked for a CAF ( assessment ) but they have said he did not need one and I have to meet with her and the teacher instead .

They told me that he would not get additional help - apparently the kids have to be half dead before they get help ( yes , the teacher really did say this ) .

I know this is going to be the start of a really long road . My son is very clever but does have no concentration at all .

I feel that they are punishing him for his condition by keeping him after school , he has a disability and he is registered as disabled with the local authority - why should he be punished as such because he did not finish the work because they did not have the means to supervise him as they have advised he needs . I don ; t get it ? I 've never seen any other child kept after school .

The school had the opportunity to help but told the doc he was ' absolutely fine ' when clearly he is n't . His teacher said to the SALT 'I 'll be surprised to hear if you find anything wrong with him as I ca n't ' . His new IEP ( done the week after going to see the doc ) has 8 points on it and is 2 pages long with the same things but more added each time .

I just wondered if anyone else had been in the same situation and could offer me some advice so I can move forward from this . His IEP states he needs supervision but he does not have any supervision . Can anyone shed some light for me on where I go from here .

TIA .

I am wondering if it is possible that I can go in with him and be his 1 : 1 at times when he is going to need more help . Does anyone know if this is possible ? ?

I see . I just want to sort out before it becomes trouble . No point in shutting the door after the horse has bolted .

Thank you .

BM - I would not advise you going in to be a 1 to 1 for him .... purely because then he would come to the conclusion that you would be the only one able to do that for him and possibly not accept anyone else to help .

I have had similar problems , for my middle son it led to him being perm excluded from school as they completely ignored all the advice and he went out of control to such an extent he became violent . With my youngest son , again the advice was ignored , he shut down completely ( I had only just got him to verbalise ) and in desperation I rang the local school which had an additional needs unit . They luckily took him on without a statement and although it has not been easy , he has now reached high school and is in mainstream ( albeit with lots and lots of support ) .

Things got a lot easier when they were both statemented as then there was something official the schools had to adhere to .... youngest even has that he has to have a doodle pad to scribble on during lessons written into his , it helps his concentration strangely and has cut down on his fidget moments .
