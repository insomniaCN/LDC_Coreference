Your no Irish republican lol . No I was n't there during the war and only got the tail end . But I know many people who where involved in the thick of it and am very closely aligned with the IRSP who lost many comrades during the war . I know my history .

Sick ? He was shot during the uprising . Dying yes . But he was nt sick . And you need to go back and look at your history , actually never mind going back just learn about it as you clearly sweet FA . Connolly is now recieved as a martyr HOWEVER at the time he was nt , it was nt until after he and the others involved in the Rising had been executed that others including those in Britain intervened to stop the executions .

< / quote> 

I know he was injured fighting I just used the word sick . He was shot in the ankle while in the GPO but stayed with his men until the end !

Another sign of your total lack of knowledge and utter disrespect 

if you knew anything you would know that collins is regarded as a hero of the Republic . He tried to avoid war at all costs and it was only when Britian under Churchill forced his hand that he had no chouce but to fight and even then he NEVER resorted to terror tactics .

He fought in the 16 rising ( unlike many of the IRA who fought against the free state in the civil war ) and was part of the party who gained the 26 counties and he did his best to secure the lot . But Britain would nt have it and Ireland had no choice but accept the Free State . He worked hard in the First Dail for the betterment of the country . And AGAIN the north opted out of joining the free state .

< / quote> 

He is not regarded by a hero by any Irish republican and bit little of no - one in the north . His actions are unforgivable and he always had a choice . He should never have signed a treaty with the brits in the first place .

<quote orig_author= " silverbolt " > 
He was killed going into Co Cork to talk to the anti treaty forces to try and secure peace .

You are a gob * ** * e with no more understanding , rhyme nor reason than a member or the BNP or EDL .

And as for your military bases as " occupying forces " Well by that arguemnt Britain is also an occupied country as they too have military bases dotted about .

< / quote> 

Awk catch your self on ya freestate sellout .

The difference is that those bases are in a foreign land and are apart of the ongoing occupation !

Op , you have a lot to answer for and clearly have been brainwashed . You are refusing to listen to logical arguments and your line of reasoning is very much lacking . Just concede that you really do n't know what you are talking about . Read a history book without the bias and come back when you are informed . stop playing the victim card , it is fast wearing thin . You are bigot in terms of ' brits out ' when I bet your lineage reflects a strong British presence . You frustrate me .

No i 'm talking about the revolutionary leader who 's actions lit the fuse that led to 26 county 's becoming independent . Yeah a sick and deing man that cowards still had to tie to a chair ! His legacy clearly still lives on as your wee avatar is a the flag of the republic .

Ahahahahaha . Mick Collins was the lowest piece of scum to walk in Ireland . He sold out his comrades that previously risked their lives for him . He turned British guns on them ! He got exactly what he deserved !

I think that a little bit of Yeats could be rather neatly inserted here - do you recall the image of the " stone " from the poem Easter 1916 ? 

Here , just to refresh your memory : 

Hearts with one purpose alone 
Through summer and winter seem 
Enchanted to a stone 
To trouble the living stream .

Make of it what you will . Also , you mentioned Connolly . Yes , the manner of his death was absolutely terrible - but it was partly his demise that instigated the condemnation of the executions by the general British public , and figures such as Asquith . It was a pathetic death , but one that resonated .

Incidentally , your little spiel about Michael Collins reminded me of the days when politics were banned in the house due to the husband being a passionate Collins man , and the wife being a fervent Dev supporter .
