ROME - Pope Francis already has distinguished himself from his predecessor with a more down - to - earth style . Now he is both unnerving the Vatican and delighting the faithful by picking up the telephone and spontaneously calling people , earning the nickname “ the Cold Call Pope . ”

Earlier this month , he called to comfort a pregnant Italian woman whose married boyfriend had unsuccessfully pressured her to have an abortion . The woman , who is divorced and will be a single mother , wrote to the pope , fearing she had fallen afoul of the church . The pope offered to personally baptize the baby when it is born next year , according to an account in La Stampa , a Turin - based daily .

In August , Francis phoned a woman in Argentina who had been raped by a local police officer . The pope told her that she was not alone and that she should have faith in the justice system , according to an Argentine television news report rebroadcast in Italy .

On Aug . 7 , Michele Ferri of Pesaro , Italy , answered his phone and was startled to hear , “ Hello Michele , it ’s Pope Francis . ” Ferri said in a telephone interview he had thought it was a joke .

“ But then he spoke about the letter that I ’d written , a letter I had n’t told anyone about , not even my mother or my wife , and I knew that it was him , ” Ferri said .

He had written the pope , he said , after a “ series of tragedies in the family , ” most recently the death of his brother , who was killed in a gas station robbery in early June . “ The pope said that the letter had made him cry , ” he said .

While the papal phoning has been widely greeted with delight , it is also proving somewhat perilous , with unsubstantiated news reports of calls supposedly made by Francis - including one last week to President Bashar Assad of Syria , and another to a young distraught French gay man . The Vatican denied that the pope had made those calls .

Other Vatican analysts fear that the advent of papal phone calls could spawn disillusion among those not blessed by a call .

“ There ’s an innumerable number of people who have suffered violence or injustice who might write to the pope for a word of comfort , and it ’s clear that he ca n’t answer all of them , ” said Alberto Melloni , a Vatican historian and the director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna , a liberal Catholic research institute . “ They could think , 'See , I ’m feeling awful and the pope did n’t even call .
