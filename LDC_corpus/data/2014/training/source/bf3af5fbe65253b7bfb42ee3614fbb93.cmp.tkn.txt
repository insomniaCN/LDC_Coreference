Amid the violence , Afghan women and girls are particularly targeted . In the past two weeks , two women reporters -- one of whom was a headmaster at a girls ' school -- were murdered . Last week , two gunmen opened fire outside a girls ' school , killing two girls and wounding six others .

Then you have a lot of torn flesh on the floor from that blunt razor .

I laugh so hard every time he mentions Occam 's Razor . The poor sap has no understanding of that principle means . He thinks that if you just mention it with each claim it will somehow make him feel smart . It 's a tell tale sign of someone who does n't understand what they are talking about .

Is n't that kind of inconvenient for your theory that OBL is a CIA / Zionist tool , MaGZ ?

I have never claimed OBL was ever CIA or a Zionist . OBL is an enemy of Western Civilization , America and the Jews .

I am a little hazy on the blast aspects of the incident . Did the bomb go off in the car ? I was under the assumption that the shooter was also the suicide bomber . Was be close enough to cause significant " blast " injury to her ? Anyone have access to more details of the autopsy ( I assume there was a thorough one ) . So far I have garnished only the head injury element of the alleged " cause " .

This <a href= " http://www.youtube.com/watch ?v=Vq-DwHXx4oI">BBC video< / a> shows that the shooter and bomber were two different people .

It also indicates that she was hit by the gunfire .

heres a slow motion version , seven seconds of that video , she had clearly dropped inside the vehicle way before the blast . My belief is the shots found their mark .

An Inside Job ? The Assassination of Benazir Bhutto 

by Peter LaVenia / December 28th , 2007 

The assassination of Benazir Bhutto is the latest act in the tragicomedy that envelops Pakistani politics . As will no doubt be repeated endlessly the next few days , her father , former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , was murdered at the orders of Zia ul - Haq , military dictator of Pakistan during the late 1970s and early 1980s . As will no doubt turn out to be the case , Ms. Bhutto has also been assassinated by the Pakistani government  though most of the international media reports will focus on militant tribal , Taliban , or Al Qaeda elements from the countrys northwestern frontier , as if said groups acted without the knowledge or encouragement of influential parts of the Pakistani government .
