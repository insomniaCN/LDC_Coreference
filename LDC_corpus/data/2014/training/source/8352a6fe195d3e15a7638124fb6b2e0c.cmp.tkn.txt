Come on , you 're 42 years old ( that surprised me , I thought you 'd be in your early twenties ) you really should know better than to fall for these kind of lines .
< / quote> 
You would think that with age we mature , and you would think we would n't fall for the same lines but we do ... men and women time and time again will continue to do so . Because when it comes to affairs of the heart life really is seen through a different pair of spectacles .. And until you take them off or someone else does it for you , you are n't going to be able to see the wood for the trees ..

Not badly enough , it would seem since he 's so very willing to inflict the same misery upon his own children . This comment of his , alone , ought to make you see that he is an utter hypocrite . I took it to mean that he would not leave his wife while the children were still of school age , as far as I 'm aware there was no adultery involved with his own parents marriage break up .

Course , he 's probably just the same as many adulterers / cheats who believe they 're so clever that they 'll never get caught .

Will your daughter 's studies and life remain placid if sonnyboy 's wife founds out , chucks him out and he moves in with you in desperation ? That would nt happen because I would nt allow him to 

Do you know what he 's doing the other two or three weeks between his visits ? You have had your sexual health checked out , have n't you no I don ; t feel i need to ... ?

This is not fictional , its a marriage that has recently split up , the wife just wanted nothing at all to do with the husband , she would n't even kiss him good bye in the morning , stopped even just having a smile or a warm word for him , no matter what he did , and believe me , he did try everything , took her out , took her away , no matter what he did , she refused to acknowledge there was a problem , as far as she was concerned , this was how it was going to be , and from what he says , it was a gradual thing , she never used to be so cold .

He tried everything he could , and she just pushed him further and further away , till in the end he walked out .

Even now the marriage is over , she 's still very cold towards him , although she has now got herself another man .

Sudden or gradual change ? You 've changed the story . Sounds like the wife knew the marriage was over long before the husband did , but was too much of a coward to say so . I genuinely do n't see what your point is , are you trying to suggest they would both have been better off if he had a discrete affair rather than left her ? Surely they both now have the opportunity to build a happy future for themselves ? 

IMO a good man with a failed marriage is a lot better ' catch ' than a married man . When I am in a loving relationship I want to shout my feelings from the rooftops , for my friends and family to love them as much as I do . And those who have loved me have been exactly the same . <img src= " http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/sport-smiley-001.gif"/> That is incompatible with being the ' other woman ' .

Just because I am having a relationship with a married man does not make me a slapper . He is the only man I have been to bed with in 5 years and I currently have no concerns whatsoever about my sexual health .

Unless you 've been tested you ca n't possibly be sure .

Essentially , you 've had unprotected sex with everyone anybody you 've ever had unprotected sex with has had unprotected sex with , and anybody they had unprotected sex with too , if you follow me . <img src= " http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/wink.gif"/> 

Plenty of STIs are symptomless , and there are some that even condoms do n't protect against . You almost certainly have HPV at the very least .

I put the thread up because I really did want some opinions , whether they be good or bad . I am due to see him this week and I have been thinking for a while whether I can continue with the situation I 'm in . Not because I have any doubt about the feelings that are involved , but because I miss him a lot between the times I see him and although we phone and text daily , this is n't really enough anymore I do n't think .
