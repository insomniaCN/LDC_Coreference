Guilty Until Proven Innocent " Perhaps the bleakest fact of all is that the death penalty is imposed not only in a freakish and discriminatory manner , but also in some cases upon defendants who are actually innocent . " 
- Supreme Court Justice William J . Brennan Jr . 1994 

Innocent people are on death row and have been executed 

* More than 110 people have been exonerated from death row since 1972 , including 22 from the state of Florida alone . ( Death Penalty Information Center ) 
* The system of capital punishment is flawed at both the state and federal level . On the federal level , 3.5 % of persons whom the Attorney General has attempted to execute have been innocent . In one example of state - level problems , Illinois ( prior to Governor Ryan 's blanket commutation ) had an error rate of at least 4.5 % . ( American Civil Liberties Union ) 
* A study identified 23 instances in the last century in which a person with an extraordinarily strong case of innocence had been executed by the government . ( H . Bedeau & amp ; M . Radelet , " Miscarriages of Justice in Potentially Capital Cases " Stanford Law Review , 1987 ) 

Recent cases of possible mistaken execution 

* Virginia executed Joseph O'Dell on July 23 , 1997 despite the existence of DNA evidence that could have proved O'Dell 's innocence . The courts refused to consider this new evidence because Virginia law says that any evidence found after 21 days is inadmissible in proving the innocence of a convicted person .
* Texas executed Jesse Jacobs on January 4 , 1995 despite the prosecution 's admission that arguments they made at Jacobs' trial were false . Jacobs was convicted after the state introduced evidence that he , rather than his co-defendant , pulled the trigger on the day of the murder . At the subsequent trial of the co-defendant , the state reversed its story and said it was the co-defendant , not Jacobs , who pulled the trigger . The prosecution vouched for the credibility of Jacobs' testimony that he did not commit the shooting and did not even know that his co-defendant had a gun . Jacobs' co-defendant was also convicted , though he was not sentenced to death .
* Texasexecuted Robert Nelson Drew on August 2 , 1994 after refusing to give him a new hearing after another man signed an affidavit in which he confessed to the murder , thereby exonerating Drew .
* Texasexecuted Leonel Herrera in 1993 despite compelling evidence of his innocence . A former Texas judge submitted an affidavit stating that another man had confessed to the crime for which Herrera was facing execution . Numerous other pieces of new evidence also threw doubt on his conviction . According to the Supreme Court , however , that proof was not sufficient to stop his execution because of the late stage of his appeal .
* Virginiaexecuted Roger Keith Coleman in 1992 . Coleman 's appellate attorneys misread the statute governing the time frame for submitting an appeal and filed their brief one day too late . The Virginia state courts held that the one - day - late filing was the equivalent of no filing at all and refused to review his issues . The federal courts subsequently held that Coleman could not raise a federal claim because he had waived his state review . Finally , the Supreme Court determined that Coleman could not complain that it was his attorneys who erred because he was not entitled to an attorney in the first place . No court ever fully reviewed the evidence of his innocence prior to his execution .

Moot - Do they have the death penalty in your state ? 
< / quote> 

Yes they do . But to my knowledge they have n't used it , at least since I have lived here .

California acquired the death penalty shortly after the Manson murders because people here were so appalled and outraged at the atrocities these monsters did that nothing short of death seemed appropriate . But the death penalty bill was passed after the fact and so Manson and his gang will have the luxury of living in prison till they die .

I could be wrong but I think California may have more prisons than any other state . We have a ' three strikes and you 're out ' law . The prisons are filling up and they 're building more . I think the 3 strikes law has worked in that 2 strikers have left the state , so if they got caught again they would n't spend life in prison . Some deterent . It just caused California criminals to go to other states less stringent . I think Nevadas crime rate went up as a result .

I do n't care for 3 - strikes laws , as they strip a judge of his or her discretionary powers in these 3rd strike cases .
