I happened to watch a news review on Sky News this morning in which a bunch of journo 's were bleating on that we should n't condemn all the " innocent " and hard working journalists at News International just because a whole bunch of hacks at the Sun were arrested ... because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .

Oh poor them . <img src= " images / smilies / frown . png " / > 

This is precsisely , is it not ? , what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last two years or so ? 

Total hypocrisy . <img src= " images / smilies / angry . gif " / > 

It is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it 's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for years .

Why would they not be sympathetic to people whom are essentially their own colleagues ?

The media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt , Stephen Hester was given just a Â£6.5 M bonus in 2010 yet JPMorgan 's top executive was paid $ 21 M that year . Stephen Hester was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital - market business of Abbey National . The media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with ABN Amro with the man responsible for fixing the failure of RBS .

Moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views , it 's that simple .
