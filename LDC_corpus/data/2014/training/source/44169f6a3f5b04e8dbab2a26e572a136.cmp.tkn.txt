Hi guys . I 'm seeking some Will advice that may get a bit complicated here but bare with me .

Bit of backstory : My dad lived in America ( Indiana ) for the past 7 years . He recently died ( August 2011 ) of cancer . I was on fairly good terms with him and was out there with my sister when it happened .

I 'm not on great terms with my stepmum - I thought i was but i am starting to think the opposite .

My dad was a bank manager for HSBC over here for some 35 years . He was made redundant just before he moved to the states so he would have received a lump sum from them ( plus extra money for having two children ) . He remortgaged the house just before he left too ( my mum being oblivious to what he was planning ) .

Since his death in USA , i have his death certificate . His place of work has given 3 years health care and 1 year salary to my stepmum . She has since ( AFAIK ) tried to gather his assets / estate and has also been in touch with the HSBC pension scheme over here ( i know this because i got in touch with them too ) . They would not tell me if there was any pension left here , and would only tell me if there was ( and how much there was ) if they saw i was entitled to it . They told me a decision would be made ( late November 2011 ) and whoever was entitled to anything ( if there was anything ) would hear from them . Otherwise , no other information would be given .

I did not hear from them .

My stepmum has since pretty much vanished . I have received maybe 2 emails since that decision was made , both of which were simple and out of the blue . All other contact I have made has been ignored ( even replies to the emails she has sent me / my sister ) .

I have not heard about any kind of Will relating to my dad . I have not been told what my stepmum is doing with any of his assets or what she has received from banks / pension-wise etc. 

So here is where I am stuck . I have sent off a form today ( and fee ) to HM courts and tribunal services to search for a will / grant in this country . I do n't even know if they will know if he has passed away or not .. so that may very well come back with nothing .

I do n't even know if he had a will , and if so , was it over here ? Or in Indiana ( USA ) . I have tried googling but found nothing similar to the Will - finding facility we have over here , for Indiana . I am not on terms with my stepmum where i can ask her a question and receive a response , let alone a truthful response .

They have a house out there ( and i seem to remember she complained about having such a long mortgage left on it .. despite being in her 60s and my dad being 59 when he passed - would a bank give them a mortgage THAT long at such an age with very decent salaries ( stepmum = self employed psychologist . dad = bank manager ) . Surely that is an asset me / my sister may be entitled to ? ? But who decides and how is that enforced ? ! 

I am very stuck , and as a minimum wage worker i do nt have the funds to sit down with a lawyer and discuss this . Any advice is very much welcome ! 

Thanks guys .

first , you do not get " extra " redundancy money for having children .

Is this the position : - 

your dad , in a calculated way , took his lump sum , remortgaged the family home , and moved overseas to be with another woman 

Were you in touch with him ? 
Did he ever indicate he was going to leave you anything ?

I m sorry for your loss and ca nt help with the American side of things , I do nt know how to search for the will but hopefully someone will come along to advise .

However I m confused as to why you and your sister feel you would be entitled to the house . I would imagine that his wife would inherit that along with the outstading mortgage .
As for his pension , would that not have been sorted when he divorced your mum ?

This throws up a lot of problems .

As a bank manager , you would expect him to have made a will but people are strange and he may not have done .

If there was a will kept at home , it would n't be the first will in the world to disappear if the person who found it would benefit more from the intestacy rules .

What does your sister think about things ? Is she willing to pursue the matter with you ? 

I ca n't imagine that you would have any rights to the marital home .

Your father 's wife could have quite legitimately inherited everything he left behind . And could have quite legitimate reasons for not wishing to have any further contact with you . Unless you are able to navigate the laws around wills and intestacy in the US ( and they could differ from state to state ) you are most likely going to make yourselves very , very unhappy indeed .
