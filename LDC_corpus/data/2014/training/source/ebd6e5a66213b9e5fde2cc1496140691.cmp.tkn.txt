The US nuked Japan because the Japanese would n't surrender and thus , an invasion of the island would 've been necessary , something which would 've caused even more carnage than the decimation of both cities itself .

A large chunk of US foreign policy is not controlled by " crazy Jewish and Christian groups . " Firstly , they 're pro-Israel groups , do not bring the Jews into this as some of them could n't care less about Israel or the US . Secondly , enlighten me , how 've the Christian loonies been shaping up the US ? The US will eventually have same sex marriages , thus your theory goes right out the window .

Iran is sane by comparison ? Oh , silly me , I forgot about the stoning that still goes on in the country . Yes , you 're right , completely sane .

That 's the most imbecilic comment you 've written so far , just wait until the hawkish neocons take office in 2012 . They 'll turn Iran into one giant crater . I do n't in any way , shape or form support this but to think that Iran will be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon is absurd .

Now begone .

The Iranian people support Iran 's nuclear right .

There is no proof Iran is developing nuclear technology and they have only enriched to 20 percent which is the required amount for their research in Tehran .

The US nuked Japan because it is an evil nation which has a long history of war crimes and human rights abuse in other peoples countries .

I think you will find Jewish and zionist Christians form some fo the most powerful Lobbies in the US . Your ignorance on this is astounding . It is these groups who push for an Anti-Iranian foreign policy in America .

America executes people as well as Iran . Don ; t try and play cultural elitism on this issue .

When you claim American government officials want to destroy Iran it only supports my argument that Iran needs a Nuclear weapon .

Now you begone , this is my thread .

After discussion with Iranian friends , I would say the educated classes do not support the nuclear policy . The Islamic nut jobs may be more enthusiastic , but these are the guys who are trying to hasten the end of days .

With a few exceptions , US foreign policy was incredibly insular up until WWII and the dropping of the bomb . Your reasoning does not follow .

Your bogey men are overrated . There are also plenty of non-Jewish / Christian loonys who are concerned about the possibility of a nation whose President wishes to hasten judgement day acquiring nuclear weapons .

For all its failings America does not stone women for adultery or hang homosexuals . There is no rush for Iranian passports .
