I noticed that the doctor who worked on Bhutto is now saying he was pressured into accepting the cause of death story from officials .

The plot thickens

The electoral college does n't necessarily represent the people do they ? 

< / quote> 
Now I would n't really know . My country does n't have an electoral college .

<quote> 
I agree whether they were voted in or not it would n't absolve them of any wrongdoing so I will concede on the coup part , but does that also make Musharaf a " good " guy ? 

< / quote> 
I think that your question is a purely subjective one . Removing the stranger element of this coup you could get the following as a couple of many possibilities / perspectives .

If you look at it from the perspective that Musharraf was removing someone who was trying to consolidate his power into a dictatorship and wanted to removes those changes then you probably would say yes he is a good guy .

If you look at it from the perspective that Musharraf was overthrowing a democratically elected leader and installing himself as leader of the country without being elected then you probably would say no is is n't a good guy .

So that 's to answer your question about Musharraf bringing up corruption charges on Bhutto . She probably had dirt on him too and now we see how the political landscape works . I mean you do n't honestly think Musharraf is some kind of saint right ? 

< / quote> 
I never said that he was a saint .

Also , do we know how hard it is to bring a leader before a court to answer such charges while still in office ? 

<quote> 
I think you are ignoring the ties the governments have with the so - called " extremists " and " terrorists " . According to the article below Musharraf did n't want her back and was pressured by the US ! Even to say the government failed to protect her would imply complicity to a certain extent . Gee this excuse is becoming really tired in my eyes .

< / quote> 
I always found it a bit strange that he let her back into the country . But would you like to point out some of the ties with these people beyond some members belonging to a sect that the Taliban based their ideology upon ? 

As well as that , claiming that the failure of the government implies some form of complicity does that mean that the JFK assassination implies complicity from his own government because they did n't protect him ? 

<quote> 
So as liberals have been saying all this time , Bush 's support for Musharaf never made sense in light of so - called " democracy " and " freedom " . You sound like a puppet of the government who wants to enforce this propaganda that Musharaf is an " ally " .

< / quote> 
I do n't really understand this paragraph . I think that I need to do some reading on the US term " liberal " because I get the feeling that it is n't the same " liberal " as I 'm thinking ( no not the party ... ) .

Also , is today " call me a shill / traitor day " or something ? 

How exactly am I a puppet ? 

<quote> 
Realizing that it was the US who pressured Musharaf into allowing Bhutto back it actually gives more credence to the idea that Bhutto might have been assassinated due to her strange statement that OBL was murdered :

< / quote> 
I do n't really get it though . People have been saying that OBL has been dead for quite a while now . I think that we just have to wait and see if another video appears .

<quote> 
Another interesting coincidence : 

Retired Brigadier supervising Benazir 's security was Osama 's handler , says expert

< / quote> 
Which means what ? 

<quote> 
What 's that ? Maybe the US was behind the assassination because of her strange statement about OBL being murdered , got her to go back to Pakistan and tried to frame AQ by way of a suicide bomber ? Except it was a hasty job and they messed up because the video clearly shows she was shot and not the result of a suicide bomber . The " bombing " seemed more as a way to get rid of the assassin and not the target . All of this also supports the idea of Bhutto 's accusation of the " men around Musharraf " . We also know about the close relationship between the CIA and ISI . Sure " extremists " might have killed Bhutto , but also with the aid of these intelligence agencies , military and overall " shadowy " characters .

< / quote> 
Now do you have any proof that these " shadowy characters " did it beyond speculation ?

As we were talking earlier about the PPP doing their own autopsy , according to Wildy 's article it seems it 's not going to happen . <img src= " http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/frown.gif"/> 

<quote> 
Ms Bhutto 's husband , Asif Zardari , said that he was contacted by the Punjab home secretary who wanted permission to hold a post mortem examination , but that he refused the request .

" We know how these autopsies are conducted and how the reports can be manipulated . We also know how she died , " he told the media on Sunday .

In conservative Pakistani society , women 's bodies are rarely allowed by their relatives to be subjected to a post mortem examination . It is even avoided in the case of men due to the belief that it constitutes disrespect to the deceased .

< / quote> 
What kind of idiots are these ? Do n't they want to know what happened to her ? This is incredibly dumb , they are acting almost like twoofers , they do n't want to know the truth , they just want to keep being angry and suspicious .
