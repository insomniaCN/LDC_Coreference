NEW YORK – The Metropolitan Museum of Art has agreed to return to Cambodia two 10th - century Khmer statues that Cambodian officials had declared were looted from a jungle redoubt and given to the Met in stages more than 20 years ago .

On Friday the museum confirmed accounts from Cambodian officials that it intended to repatriate the statues , known as the “ Kneeling Attendants , ” life - size sandstone masterpieces that flanked a doorway in the Met ’s Southeast Asian galleries .

No timetable has been set , but the museum told Cambodian officials in a letter last month that it hoped to send them as soon as “ appropriate arrangements for transit can be mutually established . ”

Thomas P . Campbell , the director of the Met , said the agreement – one of the more significant in a recent spate of often controversial cultural repatriations – followed new documentary research by the museum that corroborated Cambodian claims that the works had been improperly removed from their site at the Koh Ker temple complex .

“ This is a case in which additional information regarding the ‘ Kneeling Attendants ’ has led the museum to consider facts that were not known at the time of the acquisition and to take the action we are announcing today , ” Campbell said in a statement to The New York Times .

In a phone interview from Cambodia , Chan Tani , secretary of state , Office of the Council of Ministers , said he was excited by the news of the return .

“ This shows the high ethical standards and professional practices of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , which they are known for , ” he said . “ This also will further strengthen the excellent cooperation between the Metropolitan Museum of Art and its Cambodian counterparts in the area of cultural heritage cooperation . ”

Experts say the statues appear to have been looted around 1970 , about the time federal prosecutors say another statue , of a mythic warrior figure , was also removed from Koh Ker . That statue was pulled from auction at Sotheby ’s last year after Cambodia asked for its return . The United States moved to block the sale , and the case is pending in federal court in Manhattan .

Sotheby ’s has said that it applied all appropriate standards of provenance research before it agreed to auction the statue for $ 3 million on behalf of its Belgian owner . The auction house said it expected to prevail in court when the case goes to trial this year .

The “ Kneeling Attendants ” came to the Met in a series of gifts that began in 1987 when the British art house Spink & amp ; Son and the international art collector Douglas A . Latchford donated one of the two heads . A second head was donated by Raymond G . and Milla Louise Handley in 1989 . The two torsos were gifts of Latchford in 1992 . The matching heads and bodies were reattached by museum conservators in 1993 and placed on display the following year .

Tess Davis , a researcher on Cambodian antiquities with the Scottish Center for Crime and Justice Research in Glasgow , said the Met ’s gesture should serve as a signal to other U.S. museums that have Cambodian antiquities with provenances that are sketchy .

“ The Met could have treated Cambodia ’s request as an obstacle , ” she said . “ Instead , the museum recognized it as an opportunity to set the moral standard for the art world . ”
