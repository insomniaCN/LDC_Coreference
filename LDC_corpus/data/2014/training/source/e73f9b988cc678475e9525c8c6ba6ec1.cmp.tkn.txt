Newt Gingrich is a stupid person 's idea of what a smart person sounds like . I think it was Paul Krugman who said that , and I like it .

Gingrich is also a pathological liar . He lied about his role with Freddie Mac and every time he is caught in a lie , he tells another one . And he took an active part in destroying the economy by helping the GSEs defend themselves when some members of Congress were trying to unwind them .

He 's a gigantic hypocrite as well . While he was excoriating Bill Clinton for cheating on Hillary , and made it a special point to say he was going to bring up Monica Lewinsky every chance he got , he himself was cheating on his own wife .

On top of all that , he is corrupt . He was the first Speaker of the House in history to be fined . He was caught lying to Congress . Again , while he was trying to impeach Clinton for lying . He left his job in disgrace .

And now ... <a href= " http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/romney-s-bain-capital-leadership-attacked-as-exploiting-companies-for-cash">he's going the full Marxist< / a> route of attacking creative destruction .

Those of us who believe in free markets and those of us who believe that , in fact , the whole goals of investment is entrepreneurship and job creation , would find it pretty hard to justify rich people figuring out clever , legal ways to loot out a company ,  former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters in Manchester , New Hampshire , yesterday , ahead of the states Jan . 10 presidential primary .

Mitt Romney is not a capitalist ,  Tyler said . He is a predatory corporate mugger . If you ever wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas , you need to look no further than Mitt Romney . He can claim thousands of jobs created , only those jobs were created in Mexico and Southeast Asia . 

I do n't think that anyone has " killed it " in the debates .

< / quote> 

I think Newt has been the most accurate and forthright . He has been married 3 times , currently for 13 years to Calista , and I respect the fact that , in spite of political consequences , he has been divorced 2 times , rather than having a sting of lovers , while married to one woman , as so many other politicians try to get away with . I like Newt because I trust Newt . He is the least PC of them all , thus far , and in my opinion .

Justin Quinn : " Gingrich has been married three times , and he has been accused of having a multitude of extramarital affairs , although he has only admitted to one -- with the woman who would eventually become his third and present wife . "

Newt has been neither forthright or accurate . The constant stream of Pinocchios he has gotten from the Washington Post , on easily checked facts , demonstrates this .

..... And , managed to lower the bar , so far , even Mitt Romney .....

I 'm not a huge fan , but I have to give credit where credit is due and he 's wiping the floor with the republican field in these debates . I wish Paul was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses . He definitely offers the most substance in his replies , but a lot gets lost in translation . Romney is a milquetoast douchewagon who ca n't even give a straight answer to a simple question like ' do the states have the right to ban contraception ?' 

Get used to the idea of 4 more years of the Oh - Boy . <img src= " http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/thup.gif"/>

that was a stupid question and did n't deserve and answer .. and that 's the truth . ruth .

Did Manifold say Obama was wiping the field with the Republicans in the debates ? Um ... does he know that Obama is n't debating the Republicans ?

Krugman got the Nobel prize for economics , not peace . However , he 's still an idiot . Put him in a room with any halfway intelligent free market economist and he turns into a blubbering moron . I 've seen some debates where Krugman 's opponent had him practically in tears .
