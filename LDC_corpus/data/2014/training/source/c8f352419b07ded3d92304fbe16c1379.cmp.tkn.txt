I honestly do n't know . But what I do know is for a generation now we have tried to label bad behavior as a medical condition . That removes any element of personal responsibility and as such we 've had a generation of youth drugged by doctors diagnosis 's of this ailment or that . It 's sad 

< / quote> 

To make the painful decision to inter the appropriate rehab for the condition and stick with it takes plenty of personal responsibility ..... As for the OP , not a fan of the Governor by any stretch but I 'm fine with the decision .

< / quote> 

Do you think that rehab works ? Did it work for Any Weinhouse ? She wrote a song about how it does n't work . It made her a lot of money . Did rehab work for Charlie Sheen ? Did rehab work for Whitney Houston ? 

Rehab does n't work . The function of rehab is to teach people how to be more creative in assigning blame for their addictions .

We honor the absolute WORST among us . Schools lower flags to half mast to honor gang bangers who are murdered by other gang bangers .

< / quote> 

I hate to offer this information as I 'm sure it will be used against me later but your assumptions of what rehab teaches could n't be any further from the truth .

I 've been through rehab twice . Once when I was on parole . 90 days impatient and once court ordered after a dwi .

The main focus in rehab is on 2 things .

You are taught in great detail the effects drugs and alcohol have on your body and what happens to those organs as the addiction progresses .

Secondly they focus on individual behavior . Both the behavior that leads to use and the " new " behaviors you can use to avoided the desire to use again .

Ultimately the reason rehab fails is individual choice . In otherwords it can be a complete success if you make the individual choice to utilize the material given to you .

Antibiotics do n't always work either , but the next time your doctor gives you some i would advise taking them .

Just because a treatment does n't work 100 % does n't mean it should n't be used .

< / quote> 

Who said that ? Anyone ? Did anyone say that rehab should n't be used even if it is as useless as tits on a bull ? 

Entering rehab is NOT an exercise of personal responsiblity . It is part of the learning process to avoid personal responsibility . Addicts should NEVER be honored in any way whatsoever .

< / quote> 

Why the hell should anyone go to rehab if it 's " as useless as tits on a bull " ? It 's your point of view that ppl should n't go to rehab .

Entering rehab is an exercise of personal responsibility . Anytime someone is admitting they have a problem , and trying to fix it , they 're exercising personal responsibility .

Let 's say someone is addicted to alcohol , and runs into your burning house and saves your daughter or son 's life , would you honor that person or shame them since they 're still an addict ? 

Houston was an addict , and she donated millions and millions to charity . The hundreds and maybe thousands of ppl she helped were n't helped in any less of a way because she was an addict . She helped a hell of a lot more ppl than i 'll ever be able to , she was an addict , i 'm not .

Whitney Houston was knocking back straight whiskeys at 8 AM the day she died AFTER a night of heavy partying . It takes real committment to the lifestyle to find this honorable . Jim Beam might want to lower their company flag to half mast . That I can see . Mexico might want to lower it 's flag to half mast . That I can see . There might have been a time when Whitney Houston was a worthy person and could sing . That has n't been for 15 years at least . At the time of her death she was reprehensible .

< / quote> 

Let 's not go overboard here ... 

Reprehensible ? She had a substance abuse problem and was unable to gain control over it . Addiction has been a problem for a thousand years . Most are able to avoid it , but those who ca n't , suffer for the rest of their lives 

Again , my only objection is that I think the flag should be used to honor heroes and a pop singer is not a hero 

< / quote> 

The day before Houston died , her daughter was found in the bathtub unconscious from her own drug use . She went to the hospital and released the same day , only to be readmitted the next day . That night Houston was partying it up and the next morning was in the restaurant knocking back straights as fast as poor Emilio could bring them .

Yes this is reprehensible . Beyond reprehensible .

Whoa ... I pulled the ' give - a - shit ' meter out of the desk drawer and I could n't even get it to register .

Christie is within his rights as governor ... 

< / quote> 

Yup and if the Gov in NJ wants to honor Houston then so what . I 'm sure he 'll hear from the residents of NJ if they do n't like it .

NC flew its flags at half staff when Dale Earnhardt was killed and no one gave a shit .
