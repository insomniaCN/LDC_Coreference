In an attempt to answer what I think you 're question really is . A lot of people are n't aware of these things but , for the JFK assassination ... there was an actual government commission that in fact said there was likely a conspiracy . <a href= " http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_Assassinations">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_ ... Assassinations< / a> 

Also Martin Luther King , again many people are unaware of this , but his family won a civil lawsuit saying there was indeed a conspiracy to kill MLK . <a href= " http://actofstate.org/">http://actofstate.org/</a> I think the fact that his own family does n't even believe the official story is pretty telling . I hope this is something like the answers you were looking for .

The HSCA 's case rests on the acoustic evidence which was recorded after the assassination so they really have no case at all .

As for King , a civil suit is n't the same thing as a criminal charge , for which no agency could ever find any evidence against Lloyd Jowers . They must be in on it too . Then why did they let the civil suit proceed ? Ohh they are clever .

I do n't really care what King 's family thinks . There are plenty of mothers in the world who do n't believe their sweet little boys could ever grow up to be axe - murderers either but that do n't make it so .

I do not think it is the same ..... I am presuming John Albert reserves the tern " Conspiracy Theory " for nutty unverifiable stuff . Gladio is a different story so I am imagining that he would call it something else , though I do not know that for a fact , as obviously once upon a time " Gladio " was a " conspiracy theory " in the pejoritive sense of the term , with only a courageous lone Italian judge as its proponent , simply wondering and speculating and then of course ultimately bringing down the house , but that would be later .

Most utlimately proven to be true bona fide false flag operations , must start out as some guy 's " nutty idea " , some guy 's ridiculous conspiracy theory .

Your " courageous lone Italian judge " uncoverd Gladio as part of a criminal investigation , not because of a " conspiracy theory " .

Even assuming a conspiracy theory were true it is n't likely to be proven by a conspiracy theorist . The mindset works against the kind of patient evidence gathering and careful investigation required to break something like Watergate . They are always looking for the ' smoking gun ' , that one piece of perfect evidence that will blow the other side away . If they think they have one they latch on to it for dear life and refuse to let go even when they 're shown to be embarrassingly wrong ; discrediting themselves and whichever conspiracy they 're advocating in the process .

Watergate was silly , that was no crime ...... Big deal , Nixon was capable of and in fact did do plenty worse in 6th grade during recess .....

He was the man though , it was for the most part one guy against many ..... Not that he had no help , but it was one guy 's vision / insight that made this happen , one guy against some low life NATO thugs .....

My point is not that your description of Gladio is wrong . It is certainly correct . My point is that it is so different from the other things that this term describes that you ca n't ca n't use the same term for both of them .

Gladio was a conspiracy . This is true . It was a clandestine government black op . This is true . It was covert . This is true . But to call it a a Conspiracy Theory that was in fact true would be wrong . It was never denied by anyone . Its mechanisms are well understood . People involved in it are obvious . Once it was in the open , its mechanism became apparent to anyone with the appropriate background . We 're certainly not sitting her 10 years later arguing about whether or not it happened .

So it may be a conspiracy in Patrick - talk , but what 's the word we 're going to use for 9 / 11 Truth ? And if it 's not " conspiracy theory " , you 're going to have to go around and ask millions of people to stop using the term .

The conspiracy to get Ward Churchill fired for dissenting from Bush 's post-9 / 11 propaganda . Circumstantially evident almost immediately and ultimately proven to the satisfaction of a jury . Still quite difficult for a lot of people to accept .

I am quite unfamiliar with this case . The Great Wiki states Churchill sued for wrongful dismissal and won . What does that have to do with anything here ? It appears to me this is clearly a procedural dispute .
