Get them charged .

On 29 Dec a few years ago me and my friend were walking up the street to catch a taxi .

We had had words with a man in a nightclub earlier , he was from Nigeria , I do nt remember exactly what had happened in the nightclub but I think he had come on to my friend and she turned him down and he did nt like it .

Anyway he caught up with us as we were walking to the taxi , he ended up arguing with me mainly , he went to punch me , my friend pushed me out of the way , and then he punched her in the face .

He broke her jaw in 3 places , a couple of lads were across the street and they chased him but did nt manage to catch him ( they were chavs ) 

We went to hopsital as she was in pain and it was confirmed that she had a broken jaw , we reported it to the police and they took us in for a interview , we were interviewed seperate .

They somehow knew who we were talking about , he must have been known to them as they showed us a pic of a man and it was him .

So then we went to court , and thankfully one of the chavs had offered to be a witness as well , I was bricking it to stand up in court 

But thankfully when he arrived in court too , he saw that all 3 witness'es had turned up he changed his plea to guilty 

He got sent to jail for 6 months and the was being deported .

So its def worth reporting it

Again , very different circumstances to what happened to the OP 's DD . A broken jaw in an unprovoked attack with independent witnesses to give evidence is very different from " bruising " following a spat in a club that 's spilled out onto the street .

And I am sure the police ( with the help of CCTV ) will investigate any attack and decide on the outcome .

I am very very suprised by the actions of the police in this case . If a crime is committed surely they are duty - bound to investigate and prosecute , rather than just leaving it up to the victim to decide ? It 's up to the POLICE to check cctv - that 's their job for heaven 's sake . Remember the hoo - haa about the Jordan rape claim a little while back ? The police questioned her even though she was adamant she did n't want to do anything about it . That 's what they are supposed to do - or else surely they are just allowing people to get away with stuff due to witnesses / victins feeling vulnerable ? 

My friend 's OH was set upon by a group of lads outside a pub in the early hours and even though he was drunk and probably behaving provocatively the police were very professional and used cctv evidence to prosecute . His attacker got 6 months and had to pay him compensation .

What they 'll often do if there 's been a melee outside a club and the person who has been assualted refuses to press charges , is charge the protagonists with a public order offence ( if they have the CCTV or other solid evidence to back it up ) usually section 4 , or a more serious section 3 affray if there 's a large number of people causing trouble .

I 'm surprised by your second point though - normally when someone is sent to prison they do n't have to pay compensation as well as they would be deemed to have no way to pay it ( because they 're in prison , obviously ) .

I think any act of violence on another person needs taking seriously . The girls would otherwise do it again and may even harm someone seriously .

My son was also subjected to an unprovoked attack in which he nearly died . Both lads went to prison " briefly " but at least they may just think twice before doing it again . Both lads had viewed a fight as part of a normal night out beforehand .

Your daughter is what we call in the trade an unreliable witness .

She got thrown out of the club for some reason . I 'm sure the club will give the police full details .
She was too drunk to give an account of what happened to the police at the time - that 's not a good starting point for a prosecution .
There are CCTV pictures which may well show ( and you have to be prepared for this ) things you would rather not see - eg daughter mouthing off .

You 've only got one side of the story . I suspect that once the police have interviewed club staff , seen the CCTV and interviewed the other parties they 'll come up with a less clear - cut picture of what happened . In fact , your daughter may find herself facing a prosecution for a public order offence .
