Yeh , I 'm sure I contributed to an element of arguing when it was n't necessary .

I guess I was obscure in the idea , clear in my own mind , that some shoes could be a poor choice for people with certain kinds of foot pronation . I do n't know that they are , just that they well might be , and that understanding about your type of pronation could be useful . I assume that if pronation is " normal " the shoes may be just fine ; if not , yes , I might see an orthopedist for an opinion .

May we all have happy feet ....

Hey you guys ! I 'm here to defend the Fluevog !! 

I 'm sorry if you find them ugly , Chai , but I mentioned them because I bought a pair when Fox & amp ; Fluevog had one of their first outlets in Gastown , Vancouver , way back in the hippy - dippy days ... ( we 're talking early 1970's ) ... 

I paid the astronomical sum of $ 35 for a pair of their clogs ( open - toed ) which , when my salary was $ 500 / month , was a lot !! They were the most comfy shoe I have ever worn . So there ! 

I could afford a pair today , but like you say , they are fugly ! <img src= " http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt= " Laughing " / >

Just to prove I 'm not making it up <img src= " http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt= " Smile " / > 

John and his longtime friend and ex - partner , Peter Fox , go back to biblical times . In those days , such scriptural characters as Methuselah lived to be , quite literally , thousands of years old . John , himself , is thousands of years old and Peter Fox is , in fact , Methuselah . Before they founded Fox & amp ; Fluevog , in the ancient biblical age of 1970 , they were shepherds . Actually , they worked at Sheppard 's , a venerable Vancouver shoe emporium , albeit a tad on the conventional side . As you can imagine , John and Peter felt a wee bit constrained , selling brogues all day to businessmen in suits and servicing only the occasional hipster . When , one day , the miraculous happened , it was followed by the inevitable : an old warehouse full of turn - of - the - century footwear ( men 's & amp ; women 's , in mint condition , no less ) became available to buy at one ridiculously low price . In a nanosecond , John and Peter were out the door and into their own store , fully stocked with brand new fifty year old shoes that , in 1969 , were right in style . Fox & amp ; Fluevog immediately became the very coolest place to treat the feet and has remained so ever since . Around 1980 , Peter heard the siren song of New York City and moved there to open his own store , specializing in design of Ladies' ( particularly wedding ) shoes . John took over the business and built it into the multinational mega corporation it is today , along the way forging his undaunted reputation for the world 's most distinctive shoes .

Wow , Mame , I 'm seeing a whole new side of you ! LOL 

I 'd like to put my . 02c worth of shoe stories too , because I worked for Florsheim Shoe Company about ten lifetimes ago .

Back in those days , we used to be able to buy shoes at 55 percent of retail , and they were really great shoes - made in Chicago . I still have Florsheims in my closet that still looks new , and I bought those back in the sixties and seventies . They 're still comfortable on my feet , but I wear them only on special occasions .

A few years ago , Florsheim Shoe Company went bankrupt , but a few months ago , the Florsheim brothers bought back the name and re-established their company . I wish them luck .

Danskos woman here . I am going to have to look up fluevogs ... 

I did try earth shoes once , in Westwood , just about ran out of the store , not so much re the ugliness , but from the cultural whappo , and my own imbalance .

Time passes , and if people like them , fine .

CI - why am I not shocked that you have perfectly good 30 and 40 yr old shoes in your closet ? <img src= " http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt= " Laughing " / > I would never have guessed that , but I am not surprised <img src= " http : / / cdn2 . able2know . org / images / v5 / emoticons / icon_smile . gif " alt= " Smile " / > Good for you - I wish I still had those clogs . That was the first purchase I made with my first paycheque as a 17 yr old working in ' downtown Vancouver' so it was very memorable . Plus , they had a hippy design on the leather <img src= " http : / / cdn2 . able2know . org / images / v5 / emoticons / icon_smile . gif " alt= " Smile " / > 

Shite , osso , now I 'm going to have to look up Danskos ! grrr ...

Well , more about me - 

fine leather soled shoes , such as florshiems ' dress shoes , were I man , would have me on foot death 's door . With my arch and metatarsals ' failure to ' rotate ' , the fine sole becomes an upward battering ram . I also ca n't wear too cushioned soles - as I 've found out by buying some very expensive walking shoes - my feet seem to be attempting to break with those .

I tried on some whatchacallits once , the tough punk sort of boots , forget the name . My version of hell .
