I do nt know if you 're trolling or not ? But , what makes you think muslims try to convert the people around them ? 

Lets be honest , the majority of the EDL are pretty closed - minded . They 're not trying to get rid of all other ethnicities to make this country composed of just britons ; but muslims , because muslims are now portrayed as malicous beings that caused the 9 / 11 . Before bombings , 9 / 11 , etc. EDL and BNP did not exist or atleast were not active and muslims were not targeted by such parties as such . Mass media has caused much of the commotion . However , EDL 's common members lack the intellect to be able to comprehend this . want evidence ? check out the EDL 's facebook page and their forums and observe the ignorance some of the members display in response to some situations . It 's pathetic .

Sorry I meant it 's far from the best way of going about it .

EDL appear to have been started by people who ( rightly ) did n't want to be taken over in their own towns and have them converted to Islam . Why should they ? Why should they be second class citizens ? 

Violent people siding with them , the media and people on here give them a bad name i suppose .

No one 's being forced to convert to Islam . That 's against Islam in itself . Tell me how they are second class citizens ? 

Also , here 's something where their leader called " every single Muslim " responsible for 7 / 7 . Really , even those that died as a result ?

Hooligans in disguise , but atleast it 's amusing when they hype up marches expecting 3000 people then 200 turn up , so they end up provoking people and then run away on coaches <img src= " images / smilies / biggrin . png " / >

There was a protest outside the Blackburn KFC who were trialling so called " halal " meat and EDL were protesting outside . Although the food was n't really halal because it was stunned first this still made me laugh . A comment on their facebook page reads .

Tonight the turn out at the KFC was pathetic ! All the so - called members of the Blackburn division and we have six stood up there ! We need to sort this out !

The EDL are n't racist , they have Muslim and minority members . They oppose Islamification of a largely secular country . Racism is putting down other races ; Islam has nothing to do with that . We do n't want Mosques everywhere in this country ... fair play on the EDL .

the rise of a far right party whose solution to this balkan situation would be reminiscent of 1933-1945 again .

Do you think the world will LET that happen ? The last European massacre I remember was in Bosnia and the world intervened to stop it , where the perpetrators behind it now face international court

Then why did Tommy threaten " every single Muslim " ? Also , I thought the EDL wants freedom and democracy ? If they really want freedom and democracy , then they should recognise that as part of democracy , you get freedom of religion and from religion ie : you do n't have to belong to any religion , but you are also allowed to practise your religion and by practising , it does mean putting religious buildings up

They do love playing divide and rule .
150 years ago , they divided and then enslaved the black population for no reason other than the advancement of the white race , at a direct cost to those of the blacks .
If they were capable of this just 150 years ago , what makes you think they have changed since then ?

LOL black people enslaved themselves in return for goods . I guess black people were technologically disadvantaged and thus they were exploited because they were weak
