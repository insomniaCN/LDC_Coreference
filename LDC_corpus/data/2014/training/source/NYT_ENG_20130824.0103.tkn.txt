JINAN , China - In a dramatic high point of his trial , Bo Xilai , the fallen Communist Party star , faced off in court Saturday with Wang Lijun , the former police chief whose flight to a U.S. consulate last year set off the biggest scandal to shake the party in decades .
< / P> 
<P> 
It was the first time the two were known to have seen each other since February 2012 , when Wang fled the southwest metropolis of Chongqing , which Bo governed for four years , for the nearby consulate . There , Wang told U.S. officials that Bo ’s wife had poisoned a British businessman , Neil Heywood , and that Bo was now persecuting Wang because he knew about the murder .

Wang , who is serving a 15 - year prison sentence for defection and other crimes , took the witness stand Saturday for the prosecution . In glasses , white shirt and neatly parted hair , he appeared much as he did in September at his own trial . Bo stared at him and took blame , to a degree , for the episode leading to Wang ’s flight .

“ I made mistakes ; I am very ashamed and I am willing to take appropriate responsibility , but whether it ’s a crime or not a crime is another matter , ” Bo testified . He added that he had not bent the law to protect his wife , because he did not believe that she had killed Heywood , and that he demoted Wang right before he fled for the consulate because he believed that Wang was unstable .

Wang testified that Bo ’s wife , Gu Kailai , secretly confessed to him Nov . 14 , 2011 , that she had just poisoned Heywood . Wang was close to Gu and kept this a secret for a while , but in late January 2012 , he said , he told Bo that his wife had murdered Heywood .

Bo is charged with abuse of power for demoting Wang and , prosecutors say , taking other steps to obstruct justice in the Heywood matter . He is also charged with taking bribes and embezzling amounts totaling $ 4.4 million . The abuse of power charge is the last one to be addressed in the trial , which began Thursday and is expected to run at least through Sunday . Bo has pleaded not guilty to all charges .

Bo was dismissed from his post in March 2012 . Soon afterward , the murder scandal became public . Gu was convicted of murder a year ago and given a suspended death sentence , essentially life in prison .
