I always laugh when people ask me if I still enjoy traveling , especially for business . The answer is simple : Of course I do . As a woman of 88 years young , that ’s right , young , I still enjoy seeing the world , meeting interesting people , and I do n’t even mind trying to negotiate the airport lines . I think it is all very exciting . Travel helps keep me young , so I am going to keep doing it as long as I can . One of the things that I do know is when you get as many rings on your tree as I now have , it is important to look forward to something every hour of every day .

When my husband , Robert Mondavi , was living we used to go on business trips together quite often . But now , since he passed away , it ’s my job as vice president of cultural affairs for the Robert Mondavi Winery to try to uphold his legacy by putting California wines alongside some of the greatest wines in the world .

I fly to so many places that sometimes it ’s difficult to keep track . But do n’t think that I get special treatment because I am a woman of a certain age . Oh my goodness , that is the furthest from the truth . Everyone today is in such a hurry . No one looks at each other , let alone takes time to be civil . Travel has become so impersonal . Everyone is plugged into their computers or staring at their phones or tablets , and they do n’t take the time to learn about the person sitting next to them . That person might be really interesting . Even if they ’re not , who cares ? Be civil . I always introduce myself to the person next to me and when the food comes , I say “ bon appétit ” just to have a little interaction . I admit the food comes very rarely now , but I still try to make a connection .

On a flight from San Francisco to London I had this one lady next to me who was doing missionary work in Rwanda . She was so very interesting . I was very much looking forward to our conversation . But a few minutes after we started talking , it was clear that she was very tired . She nodded off and slept the entire flight , and it was quite long . I am glad she got the rest she so needed , but actually I was a little jealous . I may be able to nap on a flight , but I sure ca n’t sleep on one , even if I have a few glasses of champagne .

I am not a nervous flier . I have been doing it for so many years and have experienced so much turbulence and other problems that nothing fazes me . However , on one regional flight in China I did hold on for dear life . My seatbelt was broken so I called the flight attendant to notify her . The attendant told me not to worry and that I would be fine . It was a short flight during which I simply held on to both ends of the seatbelt , prayed and then hoped for the best . Everything was fine , although I still like seatbelts that actually work .

Whenever I visit a new country , I try to find artisanal things to remember each location . The one place I did n’t even try to find anything was when I visited Myanmar , which was Burma at the time . The first sign I saw when leaving the plane was a list of things not to export . The penalty read “ Death , ” which certainly put a damper on my souvenir shopping .
