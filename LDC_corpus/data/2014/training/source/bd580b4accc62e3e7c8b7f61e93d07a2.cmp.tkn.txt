First , your claim about what " alot of guys [ sic ] " think is an unfounded assertion , and as your intent is to suggest that i think the same , it also constitutes a strawman .

Additionally , if Libby were to be incarcerated in a Federal prison , there is no good reason to assume that he would be tortured .

If you want to puke up your hatred for your imaginary " librul " enemies , carry it somewhere else where it might be on topic -- maybe the Freepers have a special forum for people who failed to complete grammar school but still should have the chance to exercise their right to shout stupid things .

Setanta , you need a sense of humor . It would help you tremendously . I suggest you try it tomorrow . I must admit though that for humor to work , it must start with a basis of truth , then expand on it for the humor .

Commuting the sentence was the right thing to do . Libby was convicted and by not pardoning him , he still has the conviction on his record and yet he gets to stay home . Good for him .

And he still has the chance to clear his name through future court action .

Well , alot of you guys feel so sorry for terrorist suspects and want them turned loose , so I thought surely you would be in favor of the family man , Libby , being excused from suffering likely torture in a prison somewhere ?

Libby was duly convicted in a court of law , with access to the best lawyers and all the human rights guaranteed to the rich and unfluential .

I guess that means he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .

A tad different from people deliberately sequestered from all rule of law and , tortured , and considered guilty no matter what .

But I guess you would n't understand that sort of thing .

I do n't know much about the case , but commuting Libby 's sentence strikes me as horribly wrong and inappropriate , since Libby was associated with the administration . Far better for a president to do this for a stranger than for someone he knows personally . The man was convicted of a crime and does n't deserve any special breaks because he was on the inside of the administration .

You would n't know humor if it bit you in the ass . And yes , humor works best with a grain of reality . That 's why your " alot of you guys " horseshit does n't qualify -- and that 's why suggesting that you book into a rubber room at Free Republic does qualify .

Though I tend to agree with you Brandon , I do think the length of the prison sentence was a bit long . As far as Bush commuting the sentence , other presidents have done the same or more for people they have ties to or are beholden to , so nothing new .
