I think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation . Ever since the intervention in Afghanistan and drone attacks of Pakistan , can anyone give me a successful attack by al - Qaeda on the West since the intervention ? Some people should know better that the United States and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary . Most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that Islamic fundamentalists have been operating in Pakistan and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .

In 2006 , Pakistan saw 657 terrorist attacks leaving 907 people dead .
In 2007 , Pakistan saw 1,503 terrorist attacks , resulting in 3,448 casualties .
In 2008 , Pakistan saw 2,148 terrorists attacks , resulting in 2,267 casualties .
In 2009 , Pakistan saw 2,586 terrorist attacks , that resulted in 3,021 fatalities .

Terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people . If we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which I will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , 385 were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the Taliban / al - Qaeda 's operations to kill civilians .

From a strategy perspective , in 2009 and 2010 , air drones were equipped with new missiles called Small Smart Weapon ( SSW ) or typically known as 'Scorpion . ' These missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets . Ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , Bloomberg reports that 1,300 militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid-2008 . The New America Foundation believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from 25 % to an estimated 6 % , with a total of 18 civilians killed since August 2010 .

On the grounds of legality , according to the Geneva Convention , members of regular armed forces – involved in conflicts – are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force . The operators in Pakistan are the United States ( USAF ) and the Pakistani military .

So , who really murders more ? Islamic fundamentalist groups total of 35,000 casualties ( since 2003 ) or the United States' 385 casualties ( since 2004 ) ?

Hmm the real figure of civilian drone death is unkown . Its likely to be much larger than the figure you 've quoted . WHo cares ? If it is 30 , 30 innocent people have died for no reason . If a guy went and blew up 30 people in London right now it would be on the news for months , and we 'd be reminded of it for the next 100 years . Why the double standards ?

It 's not double standards , there 's just an opportunity to save more lives albeit , at the expense of a few . You have to negate the individual if it benefits society as a whole . I 'm not saying it 's right , but it 's the realistic and only solution to an eroding problem in the middle east .

6 % means that a disproportionately small number of terrorist attacks were carried out by Muslims . Secondly , 9 / 11 is not the worst thing to ever happen in history . Of course it was utterly disgraceful , disgusting and wrong , but worse things have happened . Perhaps it was the most devastating terrorist attack in America , but the ones that trail behind it were mostly carried out by non-Muslims .

Secondly , and more importantly , for every American death at the hands of terrorists , even if you want to include non-Muslim ones ( ie the majority ) , there must be thousands of deaths that America has inflicted in other countries . Though attacks on America are not justified by this , it would be foolish to think that such aggression would not have repercussions .

And so what , was going to war worth America having access to him directly ? Considering that if they had of just accepted indirect access , 9 / 11 would never have happened ?

I agree America has inflicted hundreds of ' ground zeroes ' so to speak . In the last half century America has invaded 50 countries . Dropped nukes . Vietnham too just pour agent orange and other such chemicals without a care into the woods . How many civillians died there ? THe amount the Americans killed in that country is way more than anything muslim terrorists have done . Whose the real big baddy terrorist eh ? 

I think we all know .

God , zionists really do n't give a **** about human life do they ? Innocent people are dying and you talk **** .

What ?

thank you . why ca n't people think the same thing ? if it was two american kids dad there would be media furore . I did n't see these two kids names on the news ? Yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .

< / quote> 

That 's because they are our soldiers and our fellow citizens . We are n't the ones who want to oppress fellow countrymen and use civilians as shields , while planning new ways to kill Americans . Sure , these deaths are n't great , but only a very small minority are caused by us . Most of the killings in the middle - east are muslims killing muslims . You ca n't pin the blame on us .
