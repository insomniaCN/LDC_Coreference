I read here somewhere that Jane Norman had gone bust ? I do n't know if they are just closing the stores or both but I think you should see if they have a number you can call .
I would also call your bank .

They did indeed go into administration , but they 've been bought up by the Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group , so all ( as far as I 'm aware ) shops are open again and the website is up and running again - they 're a bit behind with orders for a while but back to business definitely .

I would contact the customer services team if I were you ( webenquiries@janenorman . co.uk apparently ) , and as RainbowDoll said , it 's probably a good idea to give your bank a call and check if they can cancel it .
