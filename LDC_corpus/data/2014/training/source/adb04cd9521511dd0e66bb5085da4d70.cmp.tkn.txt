That case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system .

Hell , I did n't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel . After all , do you think O J Simpson would have gotten away with murder in the 90's without his ' dream team ' ?

I am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since ... well , mankind got ' organized ' . Who wrote " All animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , " and when did he write it ? 

justice is sometimes a matter of simply , what you can afford . It has always been so .

I think you 're missing the entire point . The founding fathers understood that there would be inequality . And as is often said , they were n't trying to make everyone equal . However , they DID strive to make everyone equal under the law .

< / quote> 

they also understood that equal opportunity was paramount , and , equal outcome would not and should not ever be assured .

The purpose of this thread is two-fold .

First , it 's to dismiss the orchestrated idea that the wealthy in this country are somehow ' victims ' of class warfare when talk is floated of raising their taxes to help tackle the deficit and debt at the very same time that massive cuts are on the horizon to tackle the same deficit and debt .

Secondly , it 's to show that the REAL class warfare that exists in this country in the criminal justice system actually works in FAVOR of the wealthy and well - connected at the expense of the poor and the middle class .

Our country is supposed to be a nation of laws and not men , right ? Then why is it that our political and financial elites get pardons for their crimes or their crimes are n't even investigated when a country like France does n't have a problem putting THEIR former president on trial for corruption ? 

If our collective ideals are to have any real meaning at all , then we have to practice what we preach to others , and it 's clear that we as a nation are not doing that .

When Ford pardoned Nixon , I think everyone believed ( or at least hoped ) that Nixon 's pardon was a one time exception . Unfortunately , all it seemed to do is set a precedent for future pardons .

What is ALSO unfortunate , is that while our justice system has become ever more lenient toward the rich and powerful , it 's has also become increasingly merciless to the poor and the middle class because as I noted in the OP , the US has 12.5 times as many people in prison today as we had in prison 40 years ago . And our population has n't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last two generations .

you can do a lot with numbers as presented the way you did . You are assuming that becasue there is more people in jail now , than there was 40 years ago it is due to some mass scale of injustice .

can you relate to me how that is , exactly ?

That is the state of class warfare in our society . The rich are n't victims ; they 're beneficiaries in every sense of the definition .

< / quote> 

when a person makes an issue of the earning power and riches of another , absent particular crimes used to amass such , in a society that is upwardly mobile that provides the same playing field for all , what is it then ? 

Who is stopping others from becoming the beneficiary of same ?

Do you know the great thing about numbers . They do n't lie . However , it 's the interpretation of the numbers that matters . If crime had gone up by 1,250 % in 40 years , that could account for the higher prison numbers . And if the population of the US had risen by the same percentage , that would also explain the increase in the number of people in prision . Neithe of those things is true . And no combination of a higher population and an increase of the crime rate can account for those numbers . So , it 's something else , is n't it ? 

Perhaps you would care to offer an alternate theory .
