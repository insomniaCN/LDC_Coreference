It was reported on the ABC News that the special ops were Navy Seals Team 6 ... the same team that got Bin Ladin . A real national tragedy .

I do n't know if there is one already but I propose a very public memorial erected for these best of the best and bravest of the brave that have fallen .

The anti-military left has some diehards in Code Pink that are pissed at Obama for not surrendering to Al Qai'da , but many of the left - wing goons put down their pitchforks because they feel protesting Obama will hurt their overall socialist agenda with non-military issues .

They are willing to sit on their hands for Obama in order to ruin our economy and society .

If this happened on Bush 's watch we would have anti-war protestors on TV and marching around the USA , but not a peep with the " holy one " sitting in the White House .

There wo n't be a PR TV moment for Obama with this news story connected to Navy SEALs .

This is true . I 've always said the " Anti-War Left " are by far the biggest frauds in America . Where are all those 'Human Shields' they sent over to save Saddam Hussein ? Not seeing them being sent over to save ole Gaddafi huh ? Why not ? Do the Math . It 's all about that 'D' & amp ; 'R' thing for these people .

Wow . If true , this is shocking in so many ways . How were the Taliban able to locate and kill this Team ? It seems like it had to be an inside job . The Afghans had to be involved . I do n't believe in coincidences .

365 Coalition Troops killed this year ? Man , that 's a lot . I did n't realize the casualties were that high this year . Our MSM does n't seem very interested in covering the Afghan War much . I 'm really not sure why .

< / quote> 

They report it every day , but there 's not much to report since reporters are n't allowed in many of these operations . We do n't want Geraldo Rivera or some other reporter drawing attack plans in the sand again , do we ?

Another idiot .... 

" Bush started this war . " Yeah , Bush was behind 9 / 11 , right ? 

Oh , it was only Bush that wanted to get back at those behind 9 / 11 .

Liberals were n't claiming Afghanistan was the " legit " war during the 2008 election ? 

You asshole just make things up week to week trying to look smart .

Or even better , when are they going to syria to protect the people there ? No flotillas for the mass slaughter victims in Hama or Da'araa ? 

You want to laugh at what hypocritical , racist trash the far - left anti-war scumbags are , check out code pink 's site , there is not a fucking word mentioning syria . Or even better , call the communist / marxist lowlifes at International Answer , the other fucking trash cindy sheehan - allied group that made a name for itself fighting Bush " and his wars . " Ask them why they are not protesting the war crimes the syrian regime is committing in syria , and they 'll manufacture every BS nonsense excuse in the book .

Yes it does seem that Seal Team 6 has been decimated in this attack . How did this happen ? How did the Taliban know where to find these guys ? This smells of an inside job for sure . Afghans had to be involved in revealing the location of this chopper .

A slight disagreement . The war in Afghanistan was completely necessary . If a mistake was made there , it was when the Bush administration diverted our military forces to Iraq in 2003 before the Afghan war as wrapped up . Now we are almost having to start over again there .

It is important that we do the job right so we do n't have to go back in 5 or 10 years .
