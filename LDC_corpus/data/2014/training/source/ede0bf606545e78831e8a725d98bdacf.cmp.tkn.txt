This thread is such a breath of fresh air . I 'm so glad to see other people sharing my pain .

I am the National Sales Manager for my company working with Kmart . I received an e - mail from my buyers today requesting authorization to markdown or return product we sold them .... in 2003 . We let them return it for 4 years and stopped in 2007 .

They were only looking for 24 dollars , but here 's the catch ; I know that they have over $ 270,000 worth of my inventory that is n't supposed to be there . The thing is , If I take back my $ 24 , then I 'll get a bill for nearly 300 grand .

Their employees and leadership are such shitheads they ca n't execute any changes , and are costing the company millions and millions . My company is really small , and Kmart could have been up almost a quarter million if they just did things a regular retailer would execute . On a similar note , if they try to bully me out of the money we just cut off shipments . Enjoy old inventory . The first time they went bankrupt they cost my company millions of dollars back when they were our biggest account . Time for payback . By the way , no offense to the employees here who knew what they were doing .

Another thing adding to the mess , is that the buyers will turn over again in 6 months and it will take a year for them to catch up . All you can do is try to squeeze a new line in when no one knows who is in charge and make a few bucks ... then just ride that sweet sweet 5 year old product into the sunset .

Christ I hate Kmart ... I 'm getting depressed just thinking about it . Luckily , for every Kmart there is a Bed Bath and Beyond , Ulta , and Amazon .

Do n't worry , Kameapart is doing some wonderful " purges " right now . Getting rid of people by removing their position . Best one to date ? They removed the only person who knew out to receive product at a store .

I ca n't believe how different each store is , most of the ones I deal with have a loving idea and have their poo poo together , other ones .... it 's like roll the dice and see what they can gently caress up that day .

Amazon can be loving stupid too . I remember one time they could n't find anyone to sign for a load of boxes . So I told them once they unfucked themselves , they can pay to have the load redelivered sometime next loving week , I 'm going home . It was funny to watch someone chase me down on foot as I was driving off with a trailer full of boxes two weeks before xmas .

Best thing I 've found at Kmart so far is a PS2 copy of High School Musical with two dance pads for $ 3.99 . I feel cheated .

Truckstops are goldmines for this kind of stuff . When I was at the , I think , Sapp Bros in Omaha last summer the discount bin was full of old cassettes . Not good ones either . Hell , I would a picked up a couple if they had anything even remotely decent as my rig ( a 2004 , mind you ) anachronistically came with a cassette deck . There was only painfully bad stuff like Billy Ocean 's Christmas album and the Best of Ray Stevens .

Another thing I used to see a lot was the autobiography by the founder of Flying J , O . Jay Call . Racks and racks of them . I do n't see it too much anymore because he died and his company went bankrupt shortly after then " merged " with another .

Up until our store started closing the Borders I worked at had a Star Fox 64 Strategy Guide by Prima or one of the other non-Nintendo Power groups who did guides with a sticker marked 1999 I think . e : Might have been even earlier , do n't remember .

It never came up as old stock in the RGIS nights because I guess it was so old and had been missed so many times before it had been assumed lost or stolen . I guess someone finally bought when it went on sale . <img src= " http://i.somethingawful.com/forumsystem/emoticons/emot-iiam.gif"/>

You just reminded me how much I miss Borders . All we have now is a Barnes and Noble , and it 's in a loving mall ! <img src= " http://fi.somethingawful.com/images/smilies/emot-emo.gif"/> I just want to drive 10 minutes , park a reasonable distance from a store , and browse some books for a while . Is that too much to ask ? !
