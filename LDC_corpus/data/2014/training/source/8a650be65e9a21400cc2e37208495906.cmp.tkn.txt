And yet cops and firefighters , as emplyees of government , are under attack because of their pay and benefits .

Here 's an novel idea : If you do n't like the idea of being shot at , do n't become a cop . If you do n't like the idea placing yourself in danger , do n't become a firefighter . If you do n't like the idea of being sent to a foreign land where people want to kill you , do n't join the military . Wow , I wish I would have thought of that !
