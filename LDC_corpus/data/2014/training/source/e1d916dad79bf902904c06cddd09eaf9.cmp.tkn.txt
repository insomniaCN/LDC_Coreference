Because war is a racket .. in America , it 's a business .

Vietnam , great example .

Iraq 1 .. Bush 1 led Saddam into attacking Kuwait 

Iraq 2 .. a joke .. make that , a mass - murdering joke .

We attacked Panama to seize Noriega and lock his ass away so he could n't speak the truth about Reagan and Bush 1 .

Grenada .. what ? 

How many dead people from just those alone .. maybe 2 million ? 

Worth fighting and dying for ? .. hardly .

< / quote> 

I 've read that too ... and for the most part it 's true ... . which is why I said some things and not all .

But WWII ? I think we should have been in earlier . Should Europe not have fought Hitler ? 

Do you not believe in fighting back when we really * are * attacked ?

Presidential Candidates : 

Chuck Baldwin ( C ) Constitution Party 

Bob Barr ( L ) Libertarian 

McCain ( R ) 

Cynthia McKinney ( G ) Green 

Ralph Nader ( I ) Independent 

Obama ( D ) 

Looks like women have a candidate running for President . Why are n't women flocking to her ? What 's wrong with the Green party ? 

< / quote> 

she pisses me off she speaks about some important issues others want to avoid .. but the she gets all bipolar and starts rambling some kind of madness and total discredits her valid issue .. .. it reminds me of what Alex Jones said about David Icke .. . He makes this wonderful punch bowl of facts then throws a big turd into it .. . and no one will be drinking from that punch bowl for sometime

Ww2 and Afganistan . All the other conflicts are questionable . The 2 I know to be bullshit were viet nam and this iraq occupation .

Why would a woman vote for a woman just because she is a woman ?

Will my logic do ? 

She is the only real anti-war candidate running .

She was the first politician in American with the courage to speak truth to power to the Bush Administration on Iraq .

She has not been bought by Wall Street and stood with the vast majority of Americans on the bailout .

She is one of only a handful of politicians with the courage to speak truth about Israel .

She has been a voice for women , veterans , and the poor her entire political career .

I had similar reasons for considering voting for Gravel .

A qualified , tenable candidate that had this sort of pacifist and libertarian mindset might actually be able to make a go for the white house . But these guys are so fringe , and nutty , I would n't vote for them . Elections are always about compromising our ideals , it 's sad . I do n't like that McCain is such a hawk , and I do n't like that Obama is happy to be aggressive too - though I sort of see the need for it . / sigh

Cynthia McKinney is the hottest candidate to run for public office . I 'd vote for her based on looks alone .

It 's a tough decision for many , but it 's easy for me . I can not and will not vote for any candidate who professes war as policy . After election day I have my conscience to live with .

It does n't matter to me which pro-war candidate loses .

You mean like how we freed the Iraqis ? 

War in defense of freedom is a noble cause . But war for profit is the embodiment of evil .

How many millions of lives have been lost in wars for corporations ?
