You 're an idiot . Loads of " far right " parties advocate high taxes , why ? Because it 's based on jealousy . Poor white folks blame their own poverty on the rich . Hitler had an extensive welfare state , the BNP would punish the bankers to the point of destroying what is quite possibly the only real money maker the UK has .

< / quote> 

Lol banking is the only real money maker the UK has ... well firstly that is n't true and secondly they pay a pathetically small amount of taxes anyway so provide next to nothing to this country .

Do you really think that the West would lose to a bunch of countries that hate their own neighbours ? India and Pakistan hate each other and then there is China who hate both . The Middle East would just be destroyed if it was a total war . If anything , the ' arrogance ' would increase as a result .

There is no way in hell that NATO would lose to those countries .

< / quote> 

Pakistan is no match for India now . And in the future Pakistan will be a mere annoyance than a real threat .

China and India may have their differences , but they 'll never go to war with each other . They both stand to lose too much in the process .

China is already wrapping a fist around the West 's balls by buying up their debt and forcing the west to be economically dependent on them . Very smart those Chinese .

India should eventually get in on the act , while weaning themselves off western investment , then when the time is right , they should use economic warfare to plunge western economies into chaos , crippling their financial power , and ultimately their military power . After a few months so the West will be very vulnerable .

We 've had to endure your cr * p for generations . We 're a patient people . We don ; t have to rely on military power alone , and we can wait until the time is right .

are you aware that the arabs and whites were rival powers until the white europeans overtook following the renaissance ? 

millions of white christians were enslaved by arabs . spain , a white country was occupied by arabs for centuries . arabs conquered the old eastern roman empire , they attempted to invade europe for centuries , finally being repelled at the battle of le panto .

white people today and victims of massive levels of anti white violence all across the western world . america especially .

you are a racist .

< / quote> 

Oh , I feel so sorry for the poor white people , they 've had it sooooo bad .

Who the hell are the blacks , who were enslaved by whites to complain ? 

Who the hell are the Indians , who were enslaved and robbed blind by whites to complain ? 

They 've been sooo bad to the whites over the years , have n't they ? And it 's not like Blacks and Asians ever suffer discrimination at the hands of whites , is it ? 

Poor whites . You have it so bad .

Idiot .

from all the other taxes businesses and people pay ? Barclays paid £113 m in corporation tax in 2009 if you combine it with all the other banks it does n't even make £1billion so you are saying that in 2009 the only money the government made was £1billion ?

Who is this ' we ' ? 

Okay , China has the debt bought up , but if they were to be destroyed who would chase it up ? India are no match for any Western country , not even Belgium . Are you going to send the slum kids to attack , or how about the frail women ? 

The West has far more economic and military power than the East , to suggest otherwise shows that you 're delusional .
