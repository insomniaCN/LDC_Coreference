It has just been announced that Gerald Ford , 38th President of the United States has died . He is unique in that he was n't elected to office . His reputation in the UK was high , and he was seen as a nice man who could still take hard decisions . I remember being surprised when visiting American politicians tried to pour scorn on him after pardoning President Nixon . I think he made the right decision by so doing .

I do n't know much about his politics or his achievements , but I heard a story on the radio today and it says something about his character .

His dog made a chocolate hotdog during dinner ( this was when he was the president ) . The White House staff and Secret Service guys present scrambled to clean it up . He stopped them . He told them it 's the responsibility of the owner to clean up after his dog .

The radio show host also said that Ford was a good post-president . He stayed out of the spotlight and did n't make any waves , unlike Jimmy Carter . GHW Bush is also a good post-president .

My favorite Gerald Ford quote : 'The government that is big enough to give you everything you want is also big enough to take everything you have . ' 

His veto pen was the mightiest Presidential kung fu in our history . Not a lot got done while he was Prez , and the Republic was better off because of it .

Not wanting to take anything from this fine man whom I respect , but it sure was fun watching him leave his plane . <img src= " http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/> We need more presidents like him .

I agree with his veto legacy , also noteworthy to mention is the blanket pardon he gave to Nixon to protect the sanctity of the presidentship , helping Canada to get in to G - 8 .

He served this nation in many capacities besides the political .

He was in the Navy during WWII and served in the Pacific Theatre . Most people are aware of that .

A little known fact is that he also has a conservation legacy as well . He was the only U.S. President who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout and he was also a summer park ranger in Yellowstone during the summer of 1936 . No other U.S. President has served as a park ranger .

During his time in office he added 18 new areas to the National Park System . Among them : Chickasaw National Recreation Area , Oklahoma ; Boston National Historical Park , Massachusetts ; and Valley Forge National Historical Park , Pennsylvannia .
