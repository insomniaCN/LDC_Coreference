Um , Rick Perry is not the governor of Georgia - the state that put this man to death .

Uh , the majority of that audience that applauded for Rick Perry was not from Georgia - the state that put this man to death .

I know absolutely nothing about this case - and I seriously doubt you know much about it either , save for what you 've read in your own biased sources and save for the fact that it serves as a means to aggravate your emotions and prejudices against capitol punishment and to publish here your rancor against the " ignorant right wing . " 

I sincerely hope no injustice was served here ; I sincerely do . But this case went to jury and through the entire appeals process and made it all the way to the supreme court . THAT 's what I know , and that 's all I know . Period .

If that makes me a member of the ignorant right wing , so be it . Better that I say than being a member of what I can only assume would be the " enlightened left wing " - who 's apparent [ presumed ] enlightenment knows the truth of this case without having ever been present in the courtroom or heard evidence from either side ( well , save for the evidence put forth by the media ... ). <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/doh.gif"/>

If I could show you beyond a shadow of a doubt that they put an innocent man to death ... 

... what then ?

Here 's an interesting point to ponder . There were two executions today , Wednesday , Sept 21 , 2011 . One was the execution of a black man who was convicted of killing a white man . Protests abound . The other was the execution of a white man who killed a black man and the protests were all but nonexistent . Interesting indeed 

< / quote> 
How about this interesting fact : One was executed because he was guilty without a doubt , the other was executed even though 7 witnesses recanted their stories , and there was no evidence .

How about this . Both were executed after being convicted beyond a reasonable doubt . When those seven told there stories to the jury , they were under oath . When they recanted , they were not under oath . The system worked

You do n't believe Police sometimes coerce people ? 
I generally believe Police are good , but there are dodgy ones out there .

The West Memphis Three is a good example . Fortunately their lives were spared .

So would you favor charging those 7 who recanted their testimonies with perjury ?

The more I learned during my undergrad in forensic science the more I supported the death penalty . The more I learned about the legal system during law school the quicker I changed my mind .

They risked perjury to recant , so I think means something . If they were coerced , I would rather see the police officers in trouble rather than those 7 . If they did commit perjury , like they are essentially admitting to , then they should get whatever 's coming to them ( legally speaking ) , however it did n't save the seemingly - innocent man .

Ot there is the possibility that those seven never committed perjury but regret playing a role in man being executed , or over the years their memories have faded . After all , this was n't Davis' only conviction for shooting someone .

Mmmmm , Christians arguing over whether it is justified to murder someone who murdered someone . What an appealing religion .

Way to inject race into the topic <img src= " http://www.christianforums.com/images/smilies/thumbsup.gif"/> 

Do you believe this is about race ? 

Why are our republican friends always so preoccupied with race ?

I believe he was innocent . An innocent man died in the place of a guilty man who is still out there .

< / quote> 
The court case was held yes , but later evidence revealed someone else committed the crime . And , that person also confessed . I too believe Troy Davis was innocent . It is an evil act to follow through on something known to be dead wrong . The man who is guilty lives while an innocent man was killed . How much innocent blood will be spilled in this land ?
