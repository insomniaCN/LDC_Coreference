ALL ABOUT A - ROD ON DAY YANKEES LOSE TEIXEIRA

Hal Steinbrenner was working out at the New York Yankees ’ facility in Tampa , Fla . , on Wednesday morning when he was approached by Alex Rodriguez , the injured third baseman who has not played a game all season and is often nowhere near New York but somehow is always a focal point .
< / P> 
<P> 
During their conversation , Steinbrenner , the Yankees ’ managing general partner , talked to Rodriguez about why general manager Brian Cashman had become so enraged by Rodriguez ’s behavior the day before that he directed a profanity - laced tirade toward him in an interview with a reporter .
< / P> 
<P> 
It was the Twitter message , Steinbrenner told Rodriguez , the one in which Rodriguez declared Tuesday that his own doctor had examined his surgically repaired hip and cleared him to begin a rehabilitation assignment . To the Yankees , Steinbrenner explained to Rodriguez , that seemed like a clear case of a player usurping the team ’s normal chain of command .
< / P> 
<P> 
Which it appeared to be . But whereas Cashman had lashed out with his trademark candor , Steinbrenner , a day later , was far more measured , as is his custom . Good cop , bad cop . Owner , general manager . Two men trying to navigate through a very challenging 2013 season , with Rodriguez , as is his custom , right in the middle .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Hal did it in a more professional way , maybe , than I did , ” Cashman said Wednesday of his boss as he tried to make sense of everything that had happened .
< / P> 
<P> 
It was a straight - ahead admission by Cashman on a day in which , like any number of others in this ragged season , he had to deal with news that ranged from bad to worse . Even before he spoke to reporters about Rodriguez , he was dealing with the disclosure that Mark Teixeira , his switch - hitting , middle - of - the - order first baseman , would have surgery to repair his troublesome wrist and would be lost for the season .
< / P> 
<P> 
So Teixeira , who had already missed much of the 2013 season , is officially gone . And Rodriguez , with his huge contract , his hip issues and his links to an ongoing drug investigation , is front and center , even though he might be a month or more away from rejoining the team .
< / P> 
<P> 
Cashman said he regretted the words he used Tuesday in challenging Rodriguez ’s declaration that he was ready to start playing rehabilitation games and said he was certain that Steinbrenner was disappointed he had not exhibited more restraint . But Cashman also said that both he and Rodriguez were to blame for the unseemly episode .
< / P> 
<P> 
After ripping into Rodriguez on Tuesday evening , Cashman called and emailed him , but Rodriguez did not respond with a telephone call until late Wednesday afternoon . By then , Cashman had finished his session with reporters , so it was up to Jason Zillo , a Yankees spokesman , to provide an update . Zillo said that Randy Levine , the team president , had joined Cashman on the call with Rodriguez and that the three had a constructive 30 - minute conversation .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Everybody is on the same page , ” Zillo said .
< / P> 
<P> 
At least for the moment . As the general manager of the most scrutinized team in U.S. sports , Cashman is at a busy intersection these days , trying to keep order and plot his options as he attempts to keep his battered team in the American League East race .
< / P> 
<P> 
One of those options is Rodriguez , who , despite all his baggage , can give the Yankees something they desperately want - power from the right side of the plate , especially with Teixeira now gone .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ We need him yesterday , ” Cashman said , challenging the widespread notion that the Yankees , weary of the 37 - year - old diminished slugger and the money they owe him , do not want him back this year , or ever , and would prefer that he opt for a medical retirement .
< / P> 
<P> 
Still , the relationship between Rodriguez and the team has soured significantly since he was benched in last October ’s playoffs . It was a deterioration that Cashman did not dispute Wednesday , and it probably contributed to his outburst the day before , but Cashman characterized it as a normal ebb and flow .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ That comes and goes , ” he said . “ You ’re going to have disagreements at times , you ’re going to have conflicts at times . Relationships get strong , they get weak , they get better , they get worse over time . It ’s up to everybody involved to try and keep things together . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Make no mistake , ” he added . “ If Alex Rodriguez is healthy , we want him and I want him to play third base . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Cashman ’s stinging words Tuesday had their roots in developments that took place Monday . Cashman spent part of that day disputing a published report stating that Rodriguez had been cleared to start his rehabilitation assignment July 1 . Once a position player begins his assignment , he has 20 days before the team must call him up . Cashman declared that no date to start the assignment had been set .
< / P> 
<P> 
Then , on Tuesday , Rodriguez tweeted that he had met with Dr. Bryan Kelly , the surgeon who repaired his hip in January and that Kelly had cleared him to play .
< / P> 
<P> 
But Kelly is not authorized to clear Rodriguez . Only Cashman and the Yankees have that authority , in consultation with the team physician , Dr. Christopher Ahmad , and the team ’s trainers .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ From time immemorial , it is the organization , not the player , who makes decisions as to when a player is ready to participate in his rehab assignment , ” Levine said Wednesday .
< / P> 
<P> 
So , when notified of the Twitter message Tuesday , Cashman responded by telling ESPNNewYork that Rodriguez should “ shut up . ” He colored those comments with an expletive .
< / P> 
<P> 
And while Cashman has become increasingly outspoken in recent years , this was a departure even for him .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ I popped , '' Cashman said Wednesday . ” That ’s it . I sounded off . Reality TV at its best . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
If not for Rodriguez , Cashman might have had a calmer , if trying , day Wednesday discussing Teixeira , who was told by doctors that season - ending surgery was the best course of action to fix his injured wrist tendon . Lyle Overbay has filled in admirably at first base , but Cashman said he would look to fortify the team , as always , through the trade market . Players like Michael Young of the Philadelphia Phillies and Jeff Baker of the Colorado Rockies might intrigue him .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Lyle ’s done a great job for us , ” Cashman said . “ But my job is always to see if we can improve regardless of position . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Teixeira said that he expected to have the procedure early next week , but he will not be fully recovered until December .
< / P> 
<P> 
" You feel pretty worthless as a baseball player , '' Teixeira said of the latest development .
< / P> 
<P> 
A similar sensibility is probably making Rodriguez feel lost and lonely in Tampa . He did try to make some amends Wednesday , issuing a statement that said : “ I will continue to work hard until my efforts get me back in pinstripes and help my team win . The tweet was pure excitement about Dr. Kelly ’s prognosis . ” 
< / P> 
<P> 
Cashman said Kelly ’s input would be sought only if Rodriguez had another setback . The way 2013 has gone , that should not be discounted .
