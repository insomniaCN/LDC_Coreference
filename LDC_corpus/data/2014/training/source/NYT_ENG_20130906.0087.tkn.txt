< / HEADLINE>

<P> 
NEW YORK - The driver , who went by the name Afroduck , was fast and proud , using a dashboard camera to capture his wild 26.5 - mile journey around Manhattan in 24 minutes .
< / P> 
<P> 
The police , taunted by Afroduck , were furious .
< / P> 
<P> 
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly vowed that the driver would be caught .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ We now have license - plate readers in the city that will assist in this type of investigation , ” Kelly told reporters .
< / P> 
<P> 
Late Thursday , the police arrested Christopher Adam Tang , 30 , and charged him with six driving violations .
< / P> 
<P> 
They also seized a 2006 BMW Z4 .
< / P> 
<P> 
The police said they were able to recreate the wild ride by using surveillance video , which also ultimately allowed them to track down Tang .
< / P> 
<P> 
Tang ’s route started on the Franklin D . Roosevelt Drive at 116th Street . As he tore south on the highway , he zipped past cars and taxis and stopped only for red lights . It was night , and electronic music was playing on the car ’s sound system . He whipped around the southern tip of Manhattan before heading up the West Side Highway . He skipped the northern tip of Manhattan by turning right near the George Washington Bridge and heading back to the starting point .
< / P> 
<P> 
Soon after a video of the wild ride was posted on YouTube , the driver gave an interview to the automobile website Jalopnik .
< / P> 
<P> 
He claimed that he had set a speed record for traveling the loop around Manhattan , which he already held .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ I can do it consistently under 24 minutes and most likely beat my own record again , ” he said .
< / P> 
<P> 
He dismissed concerns that the stunt was dangerous , saying his average speed was only 66 mph .
< / P> 
<P> 
However , that takes into account stopping for red lights , and on the video , he can be seen traveling at breakneck speed as he overtakes other vehicles .
< / P> 
<P> 
Still , he acknowledged that all driving carried risks .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ Whether you ’re a good driver or not , when you ’re on the road , you have a high chance of getting hit by a drunk driver , being cut off , especially in New York , ” he told the website .
< / P> 
<P> 
Asked if he was nervous about being caught after he posted the video , he said that an accomplishment like his needed to be known .
< / P> 
<P> 
“ You frankly ca n’t identify who I am by just looking at the video , and records were meant to be broken , ” he said , although he also told the website what kind of car he had been driving .
< / P> 
<P> 
Tang , who lives in East Harlem , was charged with reckless driving , reckless endangerment , following too closely and three other counts .
