Prosecutors on Wednesday asked for a death sentence for four men who participated in the rape and murder of a 23 - year - old student last December , a goal long sought by the victim ’s family and many Indians who were horrified by the case .

“ There can be nothing more diabolic than a helpless girl put through torture , ” said Dayan Krishnan , a prosecutor , as arguments began in the trial ’s sentencing phase . He called the attack “ a case of extreme depravity . ”

All four men were convicted of all the charges against them Tuesday , but to most , the verdict seemed far less important than the sentence .

A cry for the men to be hanged went up almost immediately after the woman died of her injuries , and some of the protesters who flooded the streets carried nooses .

“ These men should be hung until death , because they do n’t deserve to live in our society , ” the victim ’s mother , Asha Devi , told a news channel Tuesday night . And Indian news services released a partial text from the dying woman ’s statement to the police , which specifically asked that her assailants be executed , as a deterrent to other criminals .

“ They should be hanged , so that such an incident does not happen with another woman , ” the statement read , according to text provided to IANS , a news service . “ They should be burned alive . ”

The woman was returning home from a movie with a male friend and boarded a private bus with a group of men , mostly working - class migrants who the police said had been drinking . While the bus circled Delhi , the men attacked the pair , knocked the woman ’s friend unconscious and took the woman to the back of the bus and raped her , sometimes using a metal rod . The two were dumped on the roadside , naked and bleeding .

The woman died two weeks later of her injuries .

One defendant , Ram Singh , who was driving the bus at times during the assault , hanged himself with his bedsheet in his Delhi prison cell this year . His family said he had been subjected to sustained abuse while in custody , and at one point had been forced to drink urine . They believe he was murdered by the police .

A second defendant , who has not been named because he is a juvenile , was sentenced last month to three years in a juvenile detention center - the heaviest sentence possible in India ’s juvenile justice system .
