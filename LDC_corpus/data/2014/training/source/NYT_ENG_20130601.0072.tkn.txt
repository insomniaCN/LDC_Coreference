About 4 a.m. Wednesday , Janice Wilson got a Facebook message from the mother of a longtime friend , Nicole Lynn Mansfield , who was worried that she had not heard from her daughter since before Mother ’s Day . She asked Wilson to please “ do some homework ” and help track her down .

The next day , FBI agents from Detroit ’s field office showed up in Flint , Mich . , with grim news for Mansfield ’s mother and other members of the family . They had reports and images , broadcast by pro-government news media agencies in Syria , claiming that Mansfield , 33 , and a British man were among three people killed in Syria on Wednesday during a confrontation with government forces .

The state media agencies broadcast a video of a bullet - riddled car in which , they said , Mansfield had been a passenger . They said she had tossed a grenade at government forces before they fired upon the car in Idlib province in the north of Syria . They displayed photos of Mansfield ’s Michigan driver ’s license , alongside photos of her body , covered in blood , with a report claiming that she was working on behalf of one of Syria ’s rebel groups .

The news came as a shock to Mansfield ’s family , including her 18 - year - old daughter , and to Wilson , 32 , of Detroit . They said they knew Mansfield was away but had no idea that she was in Syria .

“ She was a good person , a peaceful person , ” Wilson said . “ She is all about peace . She is all about helping people . I do n’t understand this . She texted me about three and a half weeks ago and said she was coming home . ”

Activists reached by telephone in Idlib province said they believed that Mansfield may have worked as a lookout or a “ media coordinator ” for one of the many Islamist rebel groups battling the Syrian government there . They said they believed she worked alongside Ali al - Munasifi , the British man , who was also killed and identified by the state media news agency as being in the car with her . The third man in the car has not been identified .

Mansfield ’s daughter , Triana Lynn Mansfield , posted on an RIP Nicole Mansfield Facebook page : “ My mother was NOT a terrorist . She went there for a reason that is unknown . ” She went on to say that she believed that her mother was forced to stay .

A law enforcement official said the Washington field office of the FBI has opened an inquiry into Mansfield ’s death , as the agency typically does when Americans have been killed overseas .
