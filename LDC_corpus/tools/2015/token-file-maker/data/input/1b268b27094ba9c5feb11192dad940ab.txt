Hello

This is a bot of a saga but is anyone can offer me soem advice or reassurance I'd be grateful.

Back in May we were burgled. I came home from work to find the back door open, I assumed OH had left it open before going to work (he works nights). I closed it, noticed it was a bit stiff to close and started cleaning the house as I do every thurs night.
When I got to our bedroom I noticed OH's safe which is screwed to the wall at the bottom of our wardrobe was missing. Again, I presumed that OH had moved it as he had been talking about doing so. I thought nothing more of it and carried on cleaning. OH rang me at 8pm as he does every night and when I told him he had left the back door open he said he hadn't and asked me if anything had gone missing, I mentioned the safe which he said he hadn't moved and we realised we had been burgled and I rang the police while OH made his way home from work. Many other items such as my laptop, jewellery etc were not missing and so there was no obvious sign that we had been burgled.

We had returned from holiday the week before and while we were away we had a friend of the family house sitting. We had been hearing stories when we got back of her having wild parties in our absence which is why OH was wanting to move the safe. We told the police this and explained that we wanted them to talk to her as the only thing that was missing was something that was well hidden. The police agreed it was suspicious and said they would look into it. They took a statement of contents and went back to the station. There was a lot of valuables in the safe as we had been saving in cash for the holiday and then returned what we hadn't spent to the safe. The total of missing contents was around £6000 (jewellery, cash etc).

Within three days we still hadn't heard from the police and I didn't know if they were sending forensics etc. I explained that I had probably cleaned away most of the evidence (stupidly!) but there were significant footprints on the back door where it had been booted in. The police sergant told me that the officers who attended on the night didn't think there was enough evidence to prove a crime had been committed and therefore were not reporting it as a crime. Thus meaning, there would be no investigation, no folow up and of course, no crime ref no for the insurance company.

I was not having that and so lodged a formal complaint, with which we were visitied by the Chief Inspector of the local force who adivsed the officers had not followed protocol by not explaining their suspicions on the night and giving us chance to answer. He also advised that as there had been evidence they should have logged it as a crime. He then gave us a crime ref number and said the officers in question would be subject to an internal disciplinary.

We then gave our insurance company the crime ref number and the receipts of the items stolen.

Now a rep from the insurance company is coming to our house on thursday to conduct a 2 hour interview with me and OH in order to get a written statement.

Is this normal? Have they been told by the police that there were suspicions?

I'm very worried that we will be grilled, if we were trying to pull a fast one we would have surely dropped it all by now. The fact is we were burgled and these items were stolen. We haven't embellished what was taken which I know a lot of people do. The fact that the police were suspicious makes me think that the insurance company will be too and we will end up £6000 out of pocket and accused of being fraudsters.

Does anyone have any advice?

I am very worried that a) we won't be believed and b) could even be prosecuted for this when it is a genuine claim.

Hope someone can help

If you are telling the truth, you have nothing to worry about.

Do you really think the insurance company are going to part with £6+K without even asking you about it?

No of course not, and we are telling the truth. It's just the '2 hour interview' seemed a bit severe. We have never claimed on our contents insurance before and so I don't know what the correct protocol is.

I wouldn't worry...it's normal <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/biggrin.gif"/> Hubby &amp; I were grilled for about 3 hours at our interview after a house fire a few years ago <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/redface.gif"/> Admittedly it did look dodgy coz we'd only been in the house 6weeks and apparently I wasn't upset enough!!!! I was in shock for about a week!
But I suppose if I was handing over £xx,xxx I'd want to know all the ins and outs of it too <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/tongue.gif"/>

so long as you're telling the truth(which you are <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/> ) you have nothing to worry about, although it does feel intimidating. Try not to worry about it, they are there to help you but they need to look after their own interests at the same time <img src="http://images2.moneysavingexpert.com/images/forum_smilies/smile.gif"/>

Tell the truth, you pay for your insurance, you have a geniune claim. These people are not better than you, don't see them as scary. They are just doing another day at work. It will be ok.
