@edgarblythe,

One of the most fiery (and dangerous) people I've known absolutely laid down when death was coming. Seeing G go was a real eye opener.

Of course, people who work with sick animals know that when the mean ones stop being mean, death is peeking around the corner. I don't know if this goes for people generally, but that was how G went.

@eoe,

I didn't believe it before, but I believe now because I've seen it:

Some people do really die of a broken heart.

Someone dear to me was fiery, sharp, and still in relatively good health right to her late 80's.

But it was when her brother, my stepdad, passed away that she started to lose her twinkle in her eye and she got sick that year. Passed away very suddenly not long after.

It was my stepdad that had said "So and so died of a broken heart" and I would laugh. But he was right. It is possible.

I want to live as long as I can so long as my heart, mind, and body will cooperate with me. If I'm ever so heartbroken that my will to live goes, I've decided I'm not going to fight it.

Some people do decide when it is time for them to go. And I do believe we have that power to make it happen, or to extend ourselves longer if we want.

@mushypancakes,

Yes, I have known people that basically gave up and died, who should have lived longer otherwise. Just as some who might otherwise have died were too strong willed to let it happen.

@edgarblythe,

For sure.

My gramps was so sick with cancer. But he wanted to see his grandson be born.

No coincidence to me that he passed away almost a week after holding him.

People are amazing!

@mushypancakes,

My ex mother in law's mother would have easily seen a hundred years, but the relatives got greedy for her property and stuck her in a nursing home. She was aware they looted her house. She also knew they were lying when they told her they would bring her home on her birthday. She died on the birthday. Prior to these events, she was healthy enough and not bedridden or in a wheelchair.

@Chumly,

What is this biotech revolution you are referring to that we are on the verge of?

@edgarblythe,

That is very sad.

So sad too how the prospect of a few material things when someone is ill can turn some people into total vulchers.

My grandfather went after my uncle committed suicide. Less than 6 months apart. No decline, no loss of mind (except for an understandably profound depression) or body, just went to sleep one night, threw a clot, and died.

@patiodog,

(I've shared this story before so please forgive the rerun...)

My father at 86, his body growing weak, refused to live with anyone else. And definitely didn't want to go into a nursing home. That was the ultimate insult to him. My brother kept him in his own place for as long as he could but eventually, on a Thursday evening, Daddy was moved to a facility. I got into town on Saturday, we spent the day together, he slipped into a coma early Sunday and was gone by Monday morning.

A family friend said it was a wonder we didn't find a note lying on his chest reading "I told you I didn't want to come here." I've always felt that he was in control until the end and checked out like that, so quickly, because he chose to.

I just want to be ready when the time comes. I hate the idea of railing against imminent death because, you're gonna lose that battle for one and two, it indicates to me that there's unfinished business. Regrets. Things that you wanted to do but didn't. And that's so damned sad. The very thing I'd like to avoid.

But I don't want to hang around to 90 and beyond and bury my stepkids and family and friends younger than me. I realize that we adapt to whatever situation but I don't want to be the last one standing and can't imagine what that must be like. I haven't found the nerve to ask my aunt about it.

@eoe,

No, no, no - if you could guarantee me I would be healthy and active and able to be of some use to someone - It might be bearable living past my spouse and children (Heaven forbid) but no guarantees. Nope...would like to go out with my boots on.
